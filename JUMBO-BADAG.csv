post,1jdoypp,"March 14-16 Box Office Recap: It was the worst weekend of the year, as 'Novocaine', 'Black Bag', 'The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie' and 'Opus' underwhelmed. Meanwhile, 'Mickey 17' collapses a steep 61% on its second weekend.","https://preview.redd.it/tc7irrhhmbpe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=810ea1720f0b3db3221738848d968cb2f2c3bbf6

It was a brutal weekend for theaters.

Despite five films opening in wide release, there wasn't a single film above $10 million this weekend, and all of them fell under their modest expectations. This allowed ***Novocaine*** to take the top spot, while last week's champ ***Mickey 17*** had a terrible second weekend drop.

The whole line-up earned a combined $50.8 million this weekend. That's not only a steep 42% drop from last year, but it's also the worst weekend of the year so far. There were so many empty screenings this weekend.

Debuting in first place, Paramount's ***Novocaine*** earned $8.8 million in 3,365 theaters. Quite weak, but as mentioned, strong enough to get the top spot this weekend. For reference, Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***, earned $9.3 million in its first weekend. 

Even though it hit the top spot, one can't help but feel like the film should've done higher than this. After all, the competiton was insanely weak and Paramount spend a lot on marketing, including a Super Bowl spot. But despite a selling point (an action comedy with a man who cannot feel pain), ***Novocaine*** failed to diffentiate itself from other streaming action flicks. The audience simply wasn't big enough for that, even if reviews were positive (82% on RT).

According to Paramount, 58% of the audience was male, and 54% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a very middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is not very encouraging for its long-term prospects. Maybe it can hold on well, but for now, it would be a surprise if ***Novocaine*** came anywhere close to $30 million by the end of its run. 

In second place, Steven Soderbergh's ***Black Bag*** debuted with $7.6 million in 2,705 theaters. This debut already surpassed of Soderbergh's previous film, ***Presence*** ($6.9 million), although that film played in just 1,750 theaters and with a far smaller marketing spend.

On paper, this should be a very good debut. But the problem is that the film cost $50 million, putting it in even more pressure to deliver better numbers. This marked Michael Fassbender's latest financial misfire, after the failure of ***Next Goal Wins*** back in 2023. It's hard to think on something that could have improved these numbers. After all, the reviews are so damn fantastic (97% on RT, 85/100 on Metacritic). Like seriously, what could've been done?

According to Focus Features, 56% of the audience was male. It skewed old; 59% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, although that's better than ***Presence***'s ""C+"". Generally, a film aimed at older audiences leg out, so perhaps ***Black Bag*** could surprise in the long run. Nevertheless, no need to worry for Soderbergh; a few days ago, he confirmed that his new film, ***The Christophers***, has wrapped and could actually premiere this year. Wow, 3 films in a single year is crazy.

After is disappointing debut last weekend, ***Mickey 17*** didn't save face on its second weekend. Despite keeping PLF screens (including IMAX), the film collapsed 61%, earning just $7.4 million this weekend. That's absolutely brutal, but sadly unsurprising, given the film's tepid word of mouth.

Through 10 days, ***Mickey 17*** has made just $33.3 million. And with ***Snow White*** premiering and taking away its PLF screens, it's gonna have another steep drop this weekend. WB has also pretty much given up; they announced the film will hit PVOD on March 25, just 18 days after its release date. Right now, a $45 million lifetime is the absolutely ceilling for ***Mickey 17***.

In fourth place, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased just 32% and added $5.6 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $185.6 million, and it looks like it might hit $200 million after all. A hollow victory, nevertheless.

Debuting in fifth place, ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** flopped with just $3.1 million in 2,827 theaters. That's Ketchup Entertainment's biggest debut, but it's not really saying much, considering most of their films have flopped. We won't even bother comparing it to the previous ***Looney Tunes*** films.

This debut is not surprising. WB didn't really intend for the film to hit theaters, it was actually set for their Max streaming service. Due to a restructuring, they decided to shop the film, with Ketchup acquiring it. But still, the popularity of the ***Looney Tunes*** appears to have cooled in the past few decades. While ***Space Jam*** was a success, ***Back in Action*** flopped back in 2003 and ***Space Jam: A New Legacy*** failed to connect with audiences. Focusing the film on Porky and Daffy Duck while also omitting other characters like Bugs Bunny made it look like a non-event for many. Simply put, it's hard to ask for better numbers here.

According to Ketchup Entertainment, 64% of the audience was male and 69% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. The film failed to connect with kids; they represented just 17% of the audience. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is quite mediocre for a family film. With competition like ***Snow White*** and ***Minecraft*** on their way, this film will vanish quickly from theaters.

Pinnacle Peak released the Christian drama ***The Last Supper*** in 1,575 theaters, although it made just a weak $2.7 million this weekend. Even with an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely the film stays long in theaters.

***Paddington in Peru*** eased just 28%, adding $2.6 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $41.2 million so far.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** eased 25% and earned $2.5 million. With this, the film has earned $92.8 million, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.

In ninth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 36% and added $2.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $35.2 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Last Breath***, which fell from the third spot. It dropped 44% and added $2.2 million. This took its lifetime gross to $18.5 million.

A24's ***Opus*** finished all the way till 12th place, where it flopped with just $1 million in 1,764 theaters. This is not a surprise, given that A24 chose to scale back on marketing after the film received weak reviews in Sundance. With a ""C+"" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mickey 17*** added $15.6 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $90.4 million. Its best markets are South Korea ($17.9M), the UK ($5.8M), France ($5.3M), Germany ($2.8M) and Mexico ($2.5M). Not much to be said here.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $6 million, taking its worldwide numbers to $388 million. The best markets are the UK ($22M), Mexico ($15.2M), China ($14.4M), France ($13.6M) and Korea ($11.3M). By next week, it should finally hit $400 million worldwide. Respectable number, but not really a success.

***Black Bag*** debuted in 37 markets, where it earned $4.3 million, for a $12 million worldwide debut. Its best numbers were in France ($1.2M), UK ($1.1M) and Australia ($600K). It will continue expanding to more countries, although clearly not gonna be enough to recover its $50 million budget.

***Novocaine*** didn't feel love in the rest of the world. Debuting in 19 countries, it made a very weak $1.8 million this weekend, for a $10.6 million worldwide debut. It had very weak debuts in Mexico ($607K), South Korea ($154K) and Indonesia ($126K/No. 3). Ouch.

With $2.054 billion, ***Ne Zha 2*** has passed ***The Force Awakens*** to become the fifth highest grossing film ever.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Wicked* | Nov/22 | Universal | $112,508,890 | $473,231,120 | $795,420,331 | $150M
*Companion* | Jan/31 | Warner Bros. | $9,300,113 | $20,809,101 | $36,504,351 | $10M

- ***Wicked*** has ended its run with a fantastic $795 million worldwide. A dazzling result, but the film managed to surpass our wildest expectations. It was not front-loaded as many feared, becoming the rare $100 million opener to hit a 4x multiplier. If this film surprised you, just wait for ***Wicked: For Good*** this year to get even higher.

- ***Companion*** has ended its run after just 6 weeks, with a very weak $36 million worldwide. While the budget was $10 million, Deadline reported that WB spent a further $29 million in marketing, explaining that the film would be considered a success if it finished with $40 million-$50 million domestically. A figure that it couldn't even reach worldwide. Despite great reviews, the audience was very niche, and the film collapsed very quickly. Maybe it will find a life in streaming.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting 3 wide releases, with a clear #1. But it's very likely all three are heading for some ugly numbers.

After months of bad PR (among other things), Disney's live-action remake of ***Snow White*** is finally getting theaters after so many delays. Disney has had success with these films, and they're coming off the success of ***Mufasa***, which made over $700 million worldwide. But it looks like ***Snow White*** will be closer to the failure of ***Dumbo*** instead. Pre-sales are looking rough and Disney has already cancelled many events in advance, suggesting the film is not gonna surprise in a good way. This film cost $240 million (some estimating $269 million), putting even more pressure.

Warner Bros. is also releasing Barry Levinson's gangster film ***The Alto Knights***, which stars Robert De Niro in a dual role as 1950s mob bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. A notable aspect about the film; it's the first film that was greenlit when David Zaslav took charge as CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. But with a low marketing spend (the first trailer was released just two months ago), it's likely that the film won't be able to find an audience.

Briarcliff is also releasing Elijah Bynum's ***Magazine Dreams***, which stars Jonathan Majors as a bodybuilder. You may have heard of this film before, and it's because it premiered in Sundance back in January 2023. After earning some great reviews, Searchlight bought the film and scheduled it for December 2023. But then Majors' controversies (and subsequent conviction) caused Searchlight to drop the film. Don't expect good numbers for this film.

post,1hs8ai7,"The 1,289 movies I saw in 2024...","This is my fourth 'End of Year' recap. In January 2021, during the Covid lock-down, I began logging the many films that I watch every day, just to keep track. In the beginning I jotted a line or two about each, only to create a record. But then I started adding longer notes and more elaborate impressions, and before I knew it, I've got a 'Film Project' on my hands.

The obsessive project mushroomed. In the course of these four years, I watched and reviewed a total of **4,126 movies**; [885](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/post/673340622715944960/) in 2021, [954](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/search/954) in 2022, [998](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/search/998) in 2023, and a ridiculous number of 1,289 movies this last year.

And it seems that I'm just getting started.

As I wrote before, I owe an apology to nobody for my indulgence. I derive great pleasure from discovering daily the best movies ever made, and I enjoy even more the process of thinking about them and coming up with my own specific takes, if I can. As an un-accomplished 'Creator', composing short reviews fills me with just the right amount of self-fulfillment. The fact that I am blessed with the physical and financial ability to enjoy this type of existence right now, at the end of my own life and while civilization collapses all around us, is not lost on me either.

The project, like the many others I created before it, is purely personal, and is a strict 'labor of love'. Watching a movie today is an individual experience [Except of one visit, I haven't been to a theater in many years], and maintaining a film tumblr (which hardly anybody visits), is done as a form of mental masturbation; I do it every day because I like it a lot, and because it doesn't hurt anybody. I described my background before, so there's no need to repeat it here.

So here are some generalities, with a dozen 'Best-Of' samples below.

I've made a concerted effort to watch more films helmed by women directors - 215 in all (but only 16% of the total). Next year I will increase that number.

I like good documentaries, and of the 1,289 movies, 170 were documentaries. However, most of them were not that great. Surprisingly, only 99 were repeat films that I had watched before – it felt as if the number would be higher. I also started watching many more short films (5 to 40 minutes), and I plan focusing even more on short films in the coming year.

As I'm moving away from Hollywood-type blockbuster fair, I saw **737** “Foreign” films (read: Not American) which were 57% of the total. Next year I will be sure to increase that ratio too. Here is the break-down by country:

From the UK (108)
From France (106)
From Canada (44)
From Japan (40)
From Denmark (25)
From ""Czechoslovakia"" (24)
From Germany (21)
From Sweden (20)
From Italy & ""Russia"" (18 each)
From Israel & Poland (17 each)
From Brazil (16)
From Australia, Iran & Ireland (13 each)
From Iceland, Korea & Spain (12 each)
From Hungary (11)
From Turkey (10)
The rest were films from China, Romania, The Netherlands, Argentina, India, Yugoslavia, Belgium, Finland, Latvia, Mexico, Chile, Croatia, Norway, Austria, Cuba, Egypt, Greece, Morocco, Palestine, Scotland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Nigeria, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Haiti, Lebanon, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Afghanistan, Armenia, Colombia, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, Paraguay, Portugal, Senegal, Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia and Wales. *[But unlike 2023, no films in Babylonian this year...]*

Many of these 1,293 movies were terrible. But only 23 of them I simply couldn't finish. They included: Otto Preminger's 'Exodus', Troma Studio's 'Poultrygeist', Polanski's 1970 'A day at the beach', The Japanese 'Patisserie Coin de rue', Bob Fosse 'All that Jazz', M. Night Shyamalan 'The happening', Gene Hackman's 'Heartbreakers', Elaine May 'A new leaf', Etc. Many of the others were boring, tedious, stupid. **YMMV.**

Next year I will also start keeping track of the genres, which I haven't done up to now. I may try new things, but there are some popular genres I generally stir away from: Superheros, horror, franchise, fantasy. There were six A.I.-generated films that I saw this year. I predict that in 2025 we'll experience the first 'good' A.I. features. 

I wish I had signed up to Letterboxd at the start. It would have made sorting the list so much easier. But I've been dropping out of all social media (reddit and tumblr are the only ones still active), and I don't plan on starting on a new platform.

I only felt the urge to ""rate"" 40% of the movies that I saw (527), and of the ones that I did rate, there were 18 which I designated “Best”, and 78 to which I gave the 10/10 score. 'Best' for me usually meant that it offered a 'very' strong emotional reaction.

40 years ago I studied film at Copenhagen University, but it's only during these last few years that I've become pretty knowledgeable about the overall history of the cinema. It is therefore my favorite experience today to come across a movie I never even heard of, maybe from a different time and place, which knocks me completely over.

And so, here are a few of the less obvious gems which I enjoyed the most this year. **[Many more on the blog.](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/tagged/movies)** Check them all out if you want.

* The films of Icelandic Hlynur Pálmason (all but 'Winter brothers'). My favorite was **White, white day**, a masterful feat of slow film making, with unusual choices in its subtle direction. A policeman grieves for his wife who died in a car accident. The man renovates a house, takes care of his cute granddaughter, and then, (like ‘The Descendants’), he discovers that before she died, his beloved wife had an affair with some guy. A stunning story of heartbreak, resignation and acceptance. [The Trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSHqckdvy1A)

* Nuri Bilge Ceylan 8 films (I still haven't seen his 'Casaba' and 'Clouds of May'). My favorite of his: **About Dry Grasses** which plays for over 3 hours in the desolate, snow-covered mountains of Eastern Anatolia. Like Mads Mikkelsen in 'The Hunt’, a teacher in a small village is being falsely accused of improper behavior toward a 14-year-old girl. But the slow and meandering story embraces other themes as well, of longing, of truth seeking, of weariness, complacency and contempt. With a delusional, self centered man and the two females he misunderstands and maligns. It includes one shocking 'break the 4th wall’ moment (at 2:05:00) which illustrates that nothing we think and believe in is true. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywajc6S8YEg)

* **A brand new life** (2009), a heart-breaking Korean story, based on the director’s personal life. A sweet 9-year-old girl is abandoned by her father, who one day and without any warning drops her off at a Catholic orphanage in the countryside and leaves. Life is suddenly too painful for her. With the cutest little girl, who has to deal with life’s harshest lessons. A relatable debut feature, it uses the simplest and purest film language. It's similar to other tragic stories about innocence lost; Carla Simón’s ‘Summer 1993’, the French film 'Ponette’, and the Irish 'The Quiet Girl’ from last year, all with the same kind spirit and sad understatements. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBOOmcc3cCQ)

* **The Last Repair Shop**, winner of last year's Oscar for Best Documentary Short. A quiet story about a shop that maintains and repairs the 80,000 musical instruments used by students of the Los Angeles school district. It’s about [mending broken things so they can be whole again, performed by people who were also broken, but are now whole.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xttrkgKXtZ4) Similar to and even better than the 2017 Oscar nominee 'Joe’s Violin'.

* **Ága**, my first Bulgarian film, but it plays somewhere in Yakutsk, south of the Russian arctic circle. An isolated old Inuit couple lives alone in a yurt on the tundra. Slow and spiritual, their lives unfold in the most unobtrusive way, it feels like a documentary. But the simplicity is deceiving, this is film-making of the highest grade, and once Mahler 5th is introduced on a small transistor radio, it’s transcendental. The emptiness touched me deeply. (I should watch it again!). [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdD17TV2-84)

* [**Symphony No. 42**](https://vimeo.com/153887315) by Hungarian animator Réka Bucsi. It consists of 47 short & whimsical vignettes, without any rhyme or rhythm; A farmer fills a cow with milk until it overflows, a zoo elephant draws a “Help me” sign on a canvas, a UFO sucks all the fish from the ocean, wolves party hard to 'La Bamba’, an angry man throws a pie at a penguin, two cowboys holding blue balloons watch a tumbleweed rolls by, a big naked woman cuddle with a seal, etc. etc. Bucsi made it before Don Hertzfeldt’s 'World of tomorrow’ and even before 'Echo', my favorite Rúnar Rúnarsson’s. 10 perfect minutes of surrealist chaos.

* **Shirkers**, a 2018 documentary. Sandi Tan was an avant-garde teenage punker when she set out to make Singapore’s first New Wave road movie in 1992, together with 2 female friends and a middle aged mentor. But when the shooting was over, this 'mentor’ collected the 72 canisters of completed film as well as all supportive materials, and disappeared. For 20 years, Sandi and friends could not figure out what had happened, and eventually gave up on their groundbreaking work. This documentary pieces together the mystery, telling about the process of making the original movie, the consequences of losing - and finding it again - after all this time. Absolutely tremendous. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3wPWCj2L6I)

* **Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains** is young Chinese prodigy Gu Xiaogang's debut feature. A slow epic saga (2.5 long hours) of a large family struggling during four seasons through life’s ups and down in this provincial city. It’s a metaphor for a classic scroll painting from the 14 century, and it is apparently only the first chapter in an upcoming trilogy. A stupendous, slow-moving masterpiece told in a magnificent style, and half a dozen transcendental set pieces. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLi3WCS64Vk)

* The short jazzy documentaries of Dutch Bert Haanstra, especially **[Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3QEpQ9ozVU)** (1958), the first Oscar win for The Netherlands, and **[Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzafY7Gm0gw)**, which was made 3 years later.

* **Apollo 11**, a documentary by Todd Douglas Miller. An exhilarating re-telling of the moon landing from 2019. Perfectly crisp and emotionally laid out, without any bullshit narration, talking heads interviews or irritating recreations. Just jaw-dropping photography which puts you in the middle of the action. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Co8Z8BQgWc)

* I’ve always loved Buñuel’s last 3 films, maybe because they were so easy to watch. The fire and brimstone of his youth were distilled into accessible, vivid tableaux. Re-watching his **The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie**, (or “Six friends and the impossible dinner”) was just delightful: You nearly feel sorry for these poor 1-procenters, who can’t find a decent place to eat in. Their illogical dreams dredge out their childhood traumas, and there’s no explanations to anything that happens. It was [the New 4K trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7XNFYdQ8S8) which drew me back.

* The magical work of Australian stop-motion animator Adam Elliot. Especially, **Mary and Max**. A weirdly adult 'Wallace and Gromit', a dark and tragic clay figure story, voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette. Two damaged and unfortunate souls connect by becoming pen pals; A lonely Australian 8-year-old girl with an ugly birthmark on her forehead, and an obese Jewish New Yorker with Asperger’s. It encompasses 20 years of outlandish long-distance emotions which ends with the acknowledgment of friendship. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1W_mpSydYI)

* **Pirosmani** (1969), my first Georgian masterpiece which was not made by Sergei Parajanov. It’s an awe-inspiring biography of Nikolai Pirosmanashvíli. He was a self-taught, naïve Georgian painter who lived during Vincent van Gogh’s time, and like him, died destitute and unappreciated by his piers, only to find prominence decades after his death. It’s an absorbing and visually-stunning film, composed of rural tableaux and primitive folk setting, a mixture of Henri Rousseau, Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Bruegel and Jodorowsky. A sad, slow and formal composition, full of sublime pathos and simplicity. [Japanese Trailer here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19L9QdVdZw)

* **For the hungry boy** (2018), [my all-time favorite Paul Thomas Anderson work, even more than his “Phantom Thread”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPwfENwnMlI), out of which these discarded shots were collected. Vicki Krieps is a major crush. The score is Jonny Greenwood’s “House of Woodcock” from the movie. I've seen it at least 15 times since October.

* **Nostalgia for the light** (2010), my first film by Chilean Patricio Guzmán. His life-long work had been occupied with the Chilean coup d'état and the collective scars suffered by the people of Chile to this day. This beautiful documentary starts with examining the gigantic telescopic installations at the Atacama desert, used by astronomers to discover the origins of the cosmos. He then segues into the story the 60,000 'disappeared’, who were imprisoned in large concentration camps in the same area, and then murdered without a trace. A group of wives and sisters have been roving for decades now the same barren area, searching for bone fragments of their loved one. So both archaeologists and astronomers are looking for clues about the past. [The trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YrGqhh1KAQ)

* A woman interviewed in one continued shot: A small 1993 French masterpiece **Emilie Muller**. A young woman arrives for her first ever audition where she’s asked to show the contents of her handbag. [As soon as I finished watching it, I had to watch it again, and then a third time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om8e9494G-Q)

*“Wow! So, are there any last words you would like to say, about this whole thing?”* **No, not really.** 

Here is a [Google spreadsheet with the output of all 4 years.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16RPtkQU39SSeWqTA3Z8n1oUVliMkBRQxoBdxuscE_aE/edit?gid=695492759#gid=695492759)

Of your reviewed films in the post, I've added a few to my watch list, thanks! You definitely seem to have a 'type' of film though. I'm such a huge fan of horror that I can't help but recommend you try and dip your toes into the genre - but of course, each to their own.

So you know, Letterboxxd has an 'import data' feature where you can upload a spreadsheet to populate an account. That includes reviews, rating, date watched, date reviewed, etc. I highly recommend it - it would just take some light fiddling of your existing spreadsheet.

Do you keep a public space for your reviews? I would be interested and glad to read them too.

For Danish filmmakers, I've seen 7 of Vinterberg's (including his brand new TV-series which just premiered 'Families like ours', which was okay, but at 7 hours, a bit too long), and there were many other directors. 

My favorite is Anders Thomas Jensen; He only directed 11 movies (with 2 that are in post production now), but his debut film, *Flickering lights* is considered one of the greatest Danish films ever. I've seen my favorite of his *Riders of Justice* at least 12-15 times in the last few years. 

But his greatest strength is as a scriptwriter; He wrote 60 other movies, including another one which I've seen 12-15 times, [After the wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZzxmZuOvKI).

My all-time favorite Danish film is Nils Malmros' [The tree of knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGk38B5-Z14). It's hard to find though.

🍿

**2 thrillers with lovely Paraguayan actress Lali González:**

🍿 **Rest in peace**, a new, engaging Argentinian thriller about a debt-ridden industrialist who leaves his loving family behind in order to escape from a dangerous loan shark. Here Lali González plays a sexy young widow. The fancy Jewish wedding reminded me of a similar one in Damián Szifron’s terrific film 'Wild Tales’. The ending was weak. 💯 score on Rotten Tomatoes. 7/10.

🍿 *“Run, Victor, run!”* **7 Boxes** (2012), my first thriller from Paraguay. Like the Brazilian 'City of God’, it describes a world of acute poverty, which made it a tense watch. It tells of a young pushcart boy at the sprawling Asunción market who has to deliver some wooden boxes with unknown content. This Lali González was a cute teenager here. 6/10.

post,1fdml2l,Why are Warner Brothers so Petty Revently?,"So if you have been living under a whole mountain, the Minecraft Movie teaser has been released and you need to only visit the Minecraft Subreddit to see what the community thinks of it, let's just say negatively and emotions are at the same level they were when the ""Ugly Sonic"" meme started after a teaser for the original sonic film.

Anyways, I'm getting sidetracked, so it might be tied to the overwhelmingly negative reviews and perhaps a nice sprinkling of corporation greed, but now Warner Bros have gone on the rampage by copyrighting and claiming multiple independent and perfectly legal videos on YouTube and trying to convince the public that ""Oh they stole it"" and ""We actually own this"".

The two videos I know so far that have fallen to this fate are Mumbo Jumbo's review on the Minecraft trailer and they have claimed revenue from it. Not to mention they have also had muted a section of a Minecraft fan film (quoting Phoenix SC on the issue : ""had peanuts for a budget and it still looked better"") and all because they think ""This belongs to us >:)"".

This is sort of a discussion/question because in the comments I'd like to know your opinions on this petty manner and hopefully find some sort of reason why they have been at this for literally no reason.And I will probably respond to your question because I don't touch grass, anyways, thanks for reading! :)",hpandlotrrules,movies,0,35.0,2024-09-10 16:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fdml2l/why_are_warner_brothers_so_petty_revently/,True

Cases in point,

People have legitimate concerns for Minecraft and ways it could be improved upon, but Warner Bros ignores all of it.

Velma was panned by just about everyone, but instead of apologizing and cancelling/improving the project, they double down and sign it for a second season no one asked for.

DC is no way close to what the books are.  And instead of taking their time to make people care, they churn out barely half-baked stories that just lose them more money and get worse reviews than the one before it.

This is exactly how I felt for 5 Nights at Freddy's. Looks terrible, is probably terrible, got bad reviews from people trying to analyze it critically... but I figured it would be successful because kids want to go see a pg-13 movie based on a game popular with kids.

post,1d3cok2,Why is Anaconda Hunt for the Blood Orchid always ripped by the critics?,"Seems to me that its a very entertaining blockbuster type popcorn flick (ignore the adjective soup). I watched it as a kid and watched it again recently and I feel it holds up somewhat.

It has a decent cast, somewhat interesting, if not cheesy, characters and has a decent enough plot. Now its not a good movie, but its not bad either. Personally I think its a great saturday film to kick back and watch with some beer and popcorn.

Doubt the factual errors in it make it a bad movie - there are no anacondas in Indonesia, nor are there any tigers in Borneo.

comment,mi7us65,,"I think you're confusing your opinion and the opinion of film critics with some idea of universal truth.... 
Simply put, even if you and millions of people and the film critics all agree and say that the film is terrible, that is not the truth.... It is all subjective....
If 1 billion people agree, that simply means that 1 billion people think the same way....
For example, 1 billion people can share the same prejudice if it is an aspect of their nature...
but it still doesn't make it ""truth""....
It is all nothing more than subjective opinion...


I love great films... 
I am an avid lover of film...


I love the greatest films ever made like Chaplin's City Lights and Modern Times, Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo, also The Godfather, etc. I love the best art house films like The Passion of Joan of Arc, 
Andrei Rublev, La Dolce Vita, Moonlight and Anora, as well as really fun popcorn flicks...


I saw Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid as an adult and always felt that it was a decent adventure flick that is far better than the vast majority of B-movie creature features and Sci-fi flicks released for video or for TV....


It impressed me as a decent popcorn adventure flick that has character development, a decent adventure story, some genuinely suspenseful and scary moments, and the CGI was not nearly as bad as so many cheaply made monster flicks from the early 2000s.... 
and that's coming from someone who absolutely detests the excessive use of CGI in today's movies...


Nobody is pretending that the film holds up to the likes of Moonlight or Kurosawa's Ikiru, but if those are the only movies that the critics really like and appreciate, then that's the problem right there....


I have always felt that film should be our device for depicting our wildest imaginations and fantasies, our dreams and our nightmares...
That is why I can't only watch extremely poignant, cerebral films and pretend that adventure and fantasy and creative, imaginative films are far below the art house films....


Films like King Kong (1933), The Wolf Man (1941), The Exorcist (1973), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Excalibur, (1981), Blade Runner (1982), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Jurassic Park (1993) are all extremely creative, imaginative, fantastic, surreal, entertaining, thrilling films that are also works of art....


I feel that Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is not nearly as good as Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park, for example, but is far better than cheaply made sludge that you see on the Sci-Fi like Anaconda 3.... It was surprisingly decent and is almost as good as the original Anaconda, even if it falls a little short....",Beneficial_Window569,movies,3,,2025-03-17 06:03:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d3cok2/why_is_anaconda_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid_always/mi7us65/,False
comment,l66kcs1,,"I've looked through the reviews, including Eberts (a lot of the reviews linked on RT lead no where, probably the links are lost to time).

Most of the reviews I have seen criticize the movie for being formulaic, I honestly dont think thats a bad thing, apart from making a movie uninspired or having a feeling of being manufactured.

Some critics didn't like that this massive pharma company could only spare a small budget for this expedition that resulted in a ramshackle ferry boat being used. But I figured it made sense as it isn't a big pharma expedition, but seems more like the last ditch effort of two desperate executives (and the company went along with a modest budget on a long shot that it may work out).

Several critics didn't like the characters and found them annoying, but I thought they were alright, apart from the comic relief guy who seemed to get scared by every thing (not sure if we can blame him, taking a city person and dumping, quite literally, into the amazon river might be too much for most peoples' nerves)",SpectralVoodoo,movies,-4,,2024-05-29 14:52:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d3cok2/why_is_anaconda_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid_always/l66kcs1/,True

post,1cnfw28,The Seventh Curse (1986) is an insane martial arts horror spectacle with some gruesome practical effects,"*Story of Ricky* director Lam Ngai Kai helms this film co-written by noted trash merchant Wong Jing. In the movie a doctor/adventurer relays the tale of his most recent exploits.  Dr. Yuen Chen-hsieh visited Thailand a year earlier & ran afoul of a Dark Sorcerer that placed a blood curse on him.

Chow Yun-fat gets top billing but don't get fooled as it's a glorified cameo. The film doesn't suffer though from his lack of presence. The plot makes sense even though it contains a fair amount of mystical mumbo-jumbo. It mostly careens from one action set piece to another.

You have a hostage shootout with the cops, a monk battle, a skeleton fight, a demon fight & so much more. As I mentioned in the subject there's some nasty practical effects. The initial outbreak of the Dr's blood curse complete with pulsating veins is well done. There's also a nifty demon transformation scene & the sorcerer controls a nasty little monster he throws at people.

I honestly can't recommend this movie enough. At one point the Dr. tries to flying elbow drop a demon. The movie is available free with ads on Tubi. It's edited to some extent but I'm not sure what all is cut. The best fully uncut release is the Region B Blu-ray from 88 Fims.

The biggest difference in the Tubi version vs. ""uncut"" version, for those interested, is the curious omission of an opening framing sequence of a dinner party where the main characters are socializing and are asked by the author of the original novel (popping up in a cameo) that served as the basis for the film to recount one of their journeys, at which point the movie proper starts and the Tubi version goes from here. 

I mention that the film is portrayed as a flashback because at the end of the first act we get ANOTHER layer of flashbacks for about 15 minutes before going back to the FIRST flashback for the remainder of the film.

post,1ad0rpe,World Movies A-Z: Iceland to Iraq,"Last year as a challenge I set myself that task of watching a film set in every country, in order to expand the context and languages of my movie watching in 2023. With the year ticking over my task was unsuccessful. However I have had so much fun watching and discussing foreign films I have chosen to continue this trip around the world.

My main goal is to stick as close to alphabetical as possible, with the ideal film being set in, produced by, or at the very least primarily filmed in this country. I will be watching bad movies, great movies and everything in between with a aim to keep it diverse in genre and budget. I will give my thoughts on the movies I watch W̶e̶e̶k̶l̶y̶ when I can :) , to catalogue this adventure into world film.

Feel free to recommend any films from countries I have not yet watched or tell me what you have thought about a film if you happen to have seen it.

**Iceland - A White, White Day:** Sometimes in the films I watch the locale takes a backseat to the drama or is vacant completely. In A white, white day this is not the case, with the backdrop reflecting the themes of mystery, isolation and foreboding. The lead actor Ingvar Sigurdsson does a great job and shows his characters grief well. Glad to get a good film out of a country I was unaware had such high quality coming out of in until my research. 7.5/10

**India - The Great Indian Family:** This one is slotting in out of chronological order because I actually saw this 2023 film on release in country! I was on a rock climbing trip in India and decided to see my Indian film in cinema. I stumbled into an amazing theatre in a huge shopping center and asked the staff if I could see the next movie with English subtitles.  So there I am, ready to sit in on a lighthearted comedy surrounded by Indian families, not knowing what to expect. The opening ads completely perplexing me with their weirdness and in a language I didn't speak (no subtitles for the ads) had me off to a fun start. The movie was pretty standard comedy plot with the usual 3rd act problem and 4th resolution. Compared to western films the biggest difference was the musical numbers. A huge percentage of the budget must go into these as well as costuming. A great experience 7.5/10

**Indonesia - The Raid:** This is an absolute classic! Been on my radar for years and am happy I finally got to watch it. As a huge Matrix fan I got to experience some of those more classic kung-fu gunfights in the style I think we've been missing since the rise of John Wick type action. In the raid however it strips away the Sci-Fi of the Matrix and leave just the grit and the fast paced action. Brutal choreography in dirty close combat, the stand out being the 2v1 interrogation room fight towards the end of the movie. 9/10

Iran - The House is Black: This documentary short from 1962 about a Leper Colony is one of the most interesting films from a directing stand point so far in my list. Poetry written and read by the director Forugh Farrokhzad is hauntingly beautiful in the slower shots. Bright sun lit shots shine through the black and white photography, exposing the nature of the happy lives hidden behind grotesques facades. These slower moments then weirdly shoot up in speed with horror movie style cuts 10 -15 years before they would define the genre. Snaps to sloughing faces and quick pans to toothless mouths in corncob grin are startling, perhaps to remind us why these people have been ostracized. It's easy to hold moral high ground from a viewer perspective (especially one 60 years in the future) but I feel the director is trying to drag us back to the level or the communities that cast these poor souls out. I might be waxing on but recalling the film now as I write this makes me realise I will probably be thinking about this film for a long time. It's available on Youtube and you should check it out. 9/10

Iraq - Turtles Can Fly: Satellite, contrary to his name, isn't a orbiting celestial body but ironically the gravity and emotional center of this film. As positive an energy as could possibly be exerted within a war zone, this character, played by a real refugee by the name Soran makes you feel like you are watching an Iraqi Sandlot, Little Rascals or Stand By Me with a sprinkle of Lord of the Flies. Despite the content being heavily distressing this kid carries your mood until the last act when the storytellers behind Turtles can Fly let the emotional collapse engulf everyone, pulling you the viewer down with them. It ends in a daze that leaves you thinking. 8/10

comment,kk18l4v,,"Dangal was a huge hit in Asia, because of the uplifting message. The based on a true story angle didn't hurt.

Several choices for **Malaysia** - depending on what you like. Pulang and Sepet show more about Malaysia, Paskal is a decent action flick.

* [Paskal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MElVXaHhbCk) (Netflix) - ***Action*** - This one is about Malaysia's version of Navy Seals and how they fight the pirates of the South China Sea.
* [Pulang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiFWYHLz5ok) (Netflix) - ***Drama*** - A sailor is lost at sea, despite his family's best efforts to find him, until his grandson takes up the search. Pulang is the malay word for ""Return.""
* [Sepet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ0CDLN9Cl8) - ***Drama*** - Inter-racial love story. Very nuanced.

**Singapore - lots to choose from**

* \*\* [12 Storeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwz3T274gU0) (1997) - Drama - Critically acclaimed. Older but considered one of the most important films made about Singapore, depicting the realities of people living in crowded conditions.
* [A Land Imagined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Ie2RXRiY8) - ***Noir Crime Drama*** - Critically acclaimed. A cop tries to find some missing foreign construction workers.
* [Apprentice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxY3zZCqeTw) (2016) - ***Drama*** - Critically acclaimed. Aiman befriends the Chief Executioner who is looking for someone to take over when he retires. Watched on Netflix but it's no longer available there (at least not in the US).
* [Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ-YX-5bAs0) - ***Rom Com*** - Loved this movie. It was hilarious. It's set in Singapore, the locations are pretty good, but it only shows the uber rich subset (not the common people). Those who are wealthy though, some of the things are pretty realistic.
* [Tiong Bahru Social Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z18-VcO2me0) - Dramedy - Whimsical movie about a man who joins a social club in search of happiness. There's a Wes Anderson feel to it.

**Thailand - they are famous for their horror movies!**

* [Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYUv9wjV48) - ***Martial Arts Action*** - **Tony Jaa** kind of shot to fame when reports came out he did all the stunts FOR REAL without protection/mattresses trying to emulate his idol Jackie Chan, only to be told that Jackie Chan's stunt team actually lets him land on mattresses to minimize injuries. 
* [Shutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2TMnY3QLCs) (2002) - ***Horror*** - There's a US remake starring Jessica Alba.
* \*\* [The Iron Ladies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKq-9zmEyzI) - ***Sports Comedy Drama*** - I LOVED this based on a true story movie about a rag tag bunch of LGBTQ volleyball players struggle to be accepted and win. Very heartfelt.",Stormy8888,movies,2,,2024-01-29 00:39:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ad0rpe/world_movies_az_iceland_to_iraq/kk18l4v/,False

comment,kk53882,,"If you look at the Social Club trailer you can see the Wes Anderson feel to it. And while I have great love for The Iron Ladies, I am 100% sure you're going to LOVE Ong Bak, it is very similar to (and precedes) The Raid. Holy cow I was sweating watching that, and I'm a long time martial arts film aficionado.

Netflix has the best international selection (at least what is available in the USA) so at least for Malaysia you can watch either Paskal or Pulang, the rest may be harder to find. I also have Amazon, access is iffy unless you want to pay. Have seen several movies (with ads) on Youtube. And my other resource is the Library, they buy a lot of the more famous DVDs/Blu Rays. A few that they didn't have we patrons could ""request a purchase"" for those, I've had a 50% success rate with books and Blu Rays (but mostly books).",Stormy8888,movies,2,,2024-01-29 18:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ad0rpe/world_movies_az_iceland_to_iraq/kk53882/,False

post,16a2wet,Historically-accurate Films about Foreign Countries Needed. Ideas?,"First post here so hope not presumptuous.  Currently reading Stanley Karnow's 750 pg book ""Vietnam A History"".  Half the book covers until the 1963 coup which removed Pres. Diem (murdered), before the U.S. began sending massive troops (thank Pres. Johnson) but was active behind the scenes.  Recall no feature film for that time, just one documentary.  Seems ripe for a major film, with many interesting characters.  A film might do well once Hollywood figures there is a public who doesn't want another ""Flintstones 4"" (lost count).

Madame Nhu, the unofficial ""first lady"" (sister-in-law), is a juicy ""dragon lady"" role.  On her tour of the U.S., she ridiculed Buddhist monks burning themselves in protest.  Diem and family was from the minority Catholic - Frenchified faction.  She entranced V.P. Johnson, while Pres. Kennedy hated her.  Another good role is Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, dealing with sneaky bureaucrats and U.S. wavering on a coup.

During Madame Nhu's U.S. tour, her father (former Ambassador to U.S.) followed behind trying to reverse her outlandish statements in the media.  She manipulated her husband and Diem bowed to his brothers.  John Wayne's ""Green Beret"" covers the early days of U.S. military involvement but is outlandish, even showing the sun setting in the West (CA beach) while Vietnam only has an east coast.  Unlike many, I found Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" unrealistic and mostly a series of comedy scenes (ex. ""Git Some""), filmed outside London.  ""We Were Soldiers Once ..."" is accurate and depicts an early major battle as the U.S. began pouring in troops.

Re films about exotic countries, I found ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" good, though they had to make it about 2 white people (Mel Gibson, Sigourney Weaver) in Indonesia.  The 1966 film, ""The Battle of Algiers"" is also very accurate, if not quite Hollywood thrilling.  Almost any film about exotic foreign places until the 1950's is silly, usually filmed in the U.S. with say Italian actors posing as Polynesians and little historic accuracy.  Even films about the early U.S. are fanciful history, such as  people building barns for free for a new neighbor and revolutionaries who already know they are ""Americans"" who will beat ""the British"" (mostly a civil war against Loyalists).  Some of the more recent films and shows depict more accurate history of the times (""The Patriot"", ""Outlander"").

If Hollywood does make a ""Fall of Diem"" film, I hope they have good input from historians, like Stanley Karnow who was a reporter there at the time.",Honest_Cynic,movies,0,8.0,2023-09-04 20:23:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/,True

comment,jz5h5f7,,"Depending on how you define ""foreign"" and accuracy/realism:

[*Lawrence of Arabia* (1962)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBiZu5C6lCo) \- T. E. Lawrence and the Arab Revolt. Obviously the historical accuracy is debated, but it's broadly good (plus, the movie is a masterpiece).

[*War and Peace* (1966-67 tetralogy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIij-KQ0jYU&list=PL7EqAsBxqGgjSVnUCKe4XszPVUblcQMac) \- Napoleon's wars against Russia. Schongraben, Austerlitz, Borodino, Moscow, etc. Incredible non-CGI spectacle - huge sets and battle sequences with thousands of extras and cavalrymen.

[*Waterloo* (1970)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DcWJrzK0wU) \- Napoleon's final downfall during the ""Hundred Days"". Battle scenes with thousands of extras and cavalrymen.

[*Zulu* (1964)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBXDdOlWfTc) \- Battle of Rorke's Drift (British vs Zulu).

[*Zulu Dawn* (1979)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1tMgptVe7I) \- Battle of Isandlwana (British vs Zulu).

*La Révolution Française/The French Revolution* (1989) - Pretty self-explanatory. Epic scale and a starred cast (the movie was produced for the 200th anniversary of the Revolution).

*Dien Bien Phu* (1992) - A Vietnam war movie (about the titular battle between the French and Vietnamese) that's not from the US. Made with government cooperation and filmed in Vietnam (using the Vietnamese military as extras, along with some actual French paratroopers).

[*Come and See* (1985)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjIiApN6cfg) \- Nazi occupation of Belarus. Be aware that this film is very horrific/disturbing.

[*City of Life and Death* (2009)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx_ervF7h7w) \- Japanese atrocities at Nanjing.

*Katyń* (2007) - Massacre of Poles by the Soviet NKVD.

*The Longest Day* (1962) - D-Day from the perspective of every nation involved. With a epic scale and an all-star cast from said countries.

[*A Bridge Too Far* (1977)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6O8rLXB7Qg) \- Operation Market Garden from the perspective of every nation involved. With a epic scale and an all-star cast.

*Tora Tora Tora* (1970) - Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Non-CGI action (full-scale mockups and impressive miniature work) and location filming.

*Atentát/The Assasination* (1964) and *Anthropoid* (2016) - Assasination of Reinhard Heydrich by Czechoslovak operatives.

*All Quiet on the Western Front* ([1930](https://archive.org/details/All.Quiet.on.the.Western.Front.1930_201605) \- The Western Front (WW1) with a German perspective.

*Paths of Glory* (1957) - Souain corperals affair.

[*Faraon/Pharaoh* (1966)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqShr7gY8uo) \- Ancient Egypt. This Polish movie is more historically accurate/realistic than most films on the subject (including *Cleopatra*).

*The 300 Spartans* (1962) - Battle of Thermopylae (more historically accurate than *300*).

*Das Boot* (1981) - Battle of the Atlantic (WW2). One of the best sub movies ever made.

*Il Gattopardo/The Leopard* (1963) - Italian unification in the 1860's.

*Gandhi* (1982) - Biopic on the father of India.

*Jinnah* (1998) - Biopic on the father of Pakistan (played surprisingly by Christopher Lee).

*The Last Emperor* (1987) - Biopic on Puyi (the last emperor of China).

*The 12th Man* (2017) - The amazingly survival of Jan Baalsrud (even the seemingly ridiculous stuff is accurate). A companion piece is *Nine Lives* (1957), which covers the same story.

*The Battle of Algiers* (1966) - Algerian War of Independence. So realistic that the Pentagon screened it before the US went into Iraq.

[*Lion of the Desert* (1981)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21mRJnBBX5g) \- Lybian rebels - led by Omar Mukhtar (played by Anthony Quinn) - fighting against the Italian colonisers/occupiers. The movie was funded by Gaddafi himself and became a flop. Despite this, it's pretty good with a starred cast (who all give pretty good performances - including Quinn), epic non-CGI action, and stunning landscape visuals (the movie is also sometimes called *Lawrence of Arabia* lite, which it kind of is in a way).

*The Charge of the Light Brigade* (1968) - The famous charge. Fairly accurate to the facts.

*Potop* (1974) - The Deluge (Swedisn invasion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century). Epic action set-pieces and great costumes. And one of the BEST movie swordfights (the actors are duelling for real).

*Barry Lyndon* (1974) - British aristocracy in the 18th century. It's a Kubrick film so you can expect everything to be perfect (including the brautiful painterly visuals).",None,movies,2,,2023-09-04 21:52:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/jz5h5f7/,False
comment,jz5cref,,"This does depend on what countries you consider ""exotic"" haha, and if you mean strictly ones based on true stories or do you count fictional stories set in fairly authentic settings.  Sticking strictly to true stories:

\-[*Diên Biên Phú* (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104105/)

Account of the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ written and directed by an actual French survivor of the battle, done with the cooperation of the Vietnamese.

\-[*Il mestiere delle armi* (*The Profession of Arms*) (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245276/)

Quite accurate and authentic depiction of the latter career of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, the famous Italian condottiero.

\-[*Le retour de Martin Guerre* (*The Return of Martin Guerre*) (1982)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084589/)

Based on an infamous true story, and one of the best visual depictions of the 16th century.

\-[*Edvard Munch* (1974)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074462/)

Biopic of the life of the title Norwegian painter, famous for [*The Scream*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream)*.*  About as close as you can get to taking a movie camera back into the 19th century.

If you're open to fictional stories in authentic settings, there are even more examples.

Also, if you want accurate and authentic I'd avoid common recommendations like *The King* (2019) *The Last Duel* (2021), which are rather shite on both accounts.",theBonyEaredAssFish,movies,1,,2023-09-04 21:22:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/jz5cref/,False

comment,jz71rag,,"Keep an eye out for The Sympathiser tv series coming out next year. You may enjoy the novel given your interest in the American war in Vietnam, although obviously this is fiction (written by an American of Vietnamese descent). It is a documentary but you may also enjoy Ken Burns’ Vietnam series which covers many of the personalities and events you mention in your post - the interviews are with participants from all sides.   
First they Killed My Father and The Year of Living Dangerously are both based on books and the author of the latter also wrote a novel about journalists covering the war in Vietnam who then cover the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia (Highways to a War) which personally I think is better.

A famous documentary on the communist killings in Indonesia (which The Year of Living Dangerously uses as a backdrop) is The Act of Killing.

On a more uplifting note, there are a number of high-quality Indonesian films about key historical figures or stories about the past. I enjoyed Kartini (set during the Dutch colonial period) as well as This Earth of Mankind which covers the end of that colonial occupation and is an adaptation of a bestselling novel.",tidakaa,movies,1,,2023-09-05 05:22:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/jz71rag/,False
comment,jz58izx,,"""The Killing Fields"" was an amazing true story.  I knew a guy in grad school who got out by walking to Thailand, like the main character in the film.  A later 2017 film about the Khmer Rouge and later Vietnam invasion was ""First They Killed My Father"".",Honest_Cynic,movies,1,,2023-09-04 20:54:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/jz58izx/,True
comment,jz8squf,,"My interest is also in future films being made, historically researched for a discerning audience.  True that most great films were based on a book.  Re Southeast Asia in WWII, a good book for a film is ""Ship of Ghosts: USS Houston"".  It covers the USN ship which fought with other Allied ships (mostly Dutch) in The Battle of Java Sea, early in the Pacific War.  It was sunk west of Jakarta at night, trying to reach the Sunda Strait (Java-Sumatra) and safety in Australia.

Many USN survivors wound up working on the Burma Railroad, which is half of the book.  That was covered in the book/film ""Bridge over the River Kwai"", though less historic (river wasn't named Kwai, but Thais renamed it for tourists).  The true story is more interesting.  Many Javanese civilians were recruited with promises of free food and lodging, and died in the jungles.  The railroad was a failure, only moving a few trains between regular bombings, and mostly used to retreat from Burma.  The Japanese Army spent 3 years building it, hoping to solve the problem of supply ships sailing to Burma being regularly sunk by Allied aircraft from India.  Seems they would have figured a railroad is an easier target, but Gen. Tojo was more bluster than brains.",Honest_Cynic,movies,1,,2023-09-05 15:12:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/16a2wet/historicallyaccurate_films_about_foreign/jz8squf/,True

post,11bbpbj,Info on Blackhat's production,"Since there's been some renewed conversations around this film since Arrow is releasing it in 4K in May, I decided to compose basically a post explaining all the information I've managed to piece together about this film. Not sure if others will be as interested but one can hope. I'll try to tell it chronological order.

2011: Michael Mann learns about Stuxnet virus and is interested in learning more about hacking/cybercrime. He makes a deal with Legendary who wanted him to work on a crime film, he decided to merge his interest of crime with his desire to make a film in Asia. He collaborates with Morgan Davis Foehl on the screenplay. They both wrote it and early drafts of the script (and poster) credit them as both ""Screenplay by"" and ""Story by"". In the end, WGA arbitration meant sole credit went to Foehl.

They did a lot of research by talking to various former blackhat hackers as well as people in the US government around their hacking concerns. Foehl mentioned Max Vision was one of the inspirations for the Nick Hathaway character, Mann in other interviews mentioned he had met hackers who were also bodybuilders.

2013: Mann is scouting locations in Asia and meeting with different actors in Hong Kong. He also had recently gone to Indonesia to research The Tam and based on that visit changes the finale in the script from Turkey to Jakarta. Film goes into production. Hemsworth was cast first with the other parts being unfilled. Sadak was written as a 20 year old orphan from the Balkans and another actor was cast but fired the first day of filming as Mann wanted Yorick van Wageningen (the entire time) even though he was the wrong age and had the wrong accent. Spencer Garrett, who plays the banker Gary Baker, was apparently on location in Asia which doesn't quite track as we only see his character in Chicago very briefly. Mann also wanted Hemsowrth to be able to live code on screen in UNIX but this didn't end up happening, although the latter did learn some coding basics.

Filming takes place in a compact period of time in LA, Hong Kong, parts of Malaysia and Jakarta. Like any other Mann project, filming is exhausting. The crew worked for months straight. Mann had a 50"" in his hotel room to watch dailies, would dictate notes to the crew, which were then typed up and put under heads of departments door. They'd then have to go through the 40 plus page document by the following morning to know what they were supposed to do (as Mann would quiz them on it). Filming was all done on location in areas not really designed for filming, and Mann would frequently change his mind. For the car explosion scene, he decided last minute to change one of the camera angles (there were maybe 12). Hemsworth and Viola Davis both talked in promotional interviews about how exhausted they were from the myriad of takes Mann demanded. The scene in which Hathaway tells Sadak and Kassar to meet him in the hollowed out building was originally scripted to take part in a fishing village that the art crew took several weeks to build in Jakarta. Mann stumbled across that location by accident and shortly after the set was bulldozed.

Filming ends late summer / early fall.

2014: Joe Walker (who recently won an Oscar for Dune) was chosen as one of the editors by MM based on his work with Steve McQueen. He worked on the film for a one year assignment and remarked he had a pretty robust cut by the time he left, but wasn't sure of the differences between his edit / the theatrical cut / the director's cut. Mann relentlessly tinkers in post, the film goes way overbudget (possibly as much as $75 million over) and Harry Gregson William publicly laments his score being cut up beyond recognition. Early marketing material shows the film co-written by Mann and Foehl although the latter is the only one that gets credit. The release is set for Jan 2015 (basically dumped). Promotional materials also heavily featured ""You/we are no longer in control"" and ""It's not about money. It's not about politics. I can target anything, anyone, anywhere"" but neither of these made it into either of the finished cuts.

2015: Film is released, bombs and costs Legendary over $90 million. The film gets dumped in international markets straight to home video, including Australia despite an earlier planned theatrical rollout. Holt McCallany laments the film in an interview, saying he worked very hard and put in a very good performance but all of his scenes were cut. He was so incensed he didn't attend the premiere and the fact the film bombed both critically and commercially didn't change how he felt about it. During press for Men in Black International (in 2019), Hemsworth also mentioned he didn't like his performance in the film, that it felt flat and it was the type of role he thought people would want to see him play.

2016: At a retrospective in NY, a ""re-edited"" version of the film premieres. The original script order had the soy hack take place first, and the nuclear reactor hack take place well into the film. The theatrical cut reversed this as Mann and the studio felt it increased the sense of stakes offered, although Mann later said in reflection this was a mistake and that he was dissatisfied with the decision. He also said it was not a reaction to the film's negative critical reception. He was unsteady on if this cut would ever be released on home video, reports from the screening said he was still taking notes and tinkering with the film. He also apparently laughed when the car with Dawai explodes and when Hathaway says ""you son of a bitch"" in Perak.

2017: The BAM/NY retrospective version premieres on FX for a limited time with some edits made by Mann for the FX premiere including some remixing and other changes. It's called a director's cut The main differences are:

The film opens with the soy hack and also shows the affect of the soy spike on a Dutch ship attempting to enter port.

Hathaway is introduced slightly later (don't quote me on this)

In the scene in which Barrett is on the phone with Dawai, Robichaud is also shown to be present in the room. He confirms there's no reason to not give up the code as it will surface anyway.

After the Koreatown restaurant scene, there is reduced dialogue between Hathaway and Lien.

When arriving in Hong Kong, Jessup spots a tail behind them and they switch cars.

The scene in which Hathaway spots Sadak and Kassar in the apartment building is excised. The dialogue on the phone call between Sadak and Hathaway is changed slightly so the latter says ""meet me at the festival"", Sadak says ""it'll be packed"" which is actually from the deleted apartment sequence but it's dubbed over since we don't see him actually saying the line.

The scene in which Hathaway gets medical aid after being wounded is shortened.

2023: Arrow announces a UHD version of the film that will have just the international version which is borderline the same as the US theatrical. Mann is not involved in this home video release and they were unable to secure the rights to either the FX or BAMF versions due to rights issue, although they are on the radar if there is enough demand.",chrisandy007,movies,27,11.0,2023-02-25 04:16:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11bbpbj/info_on_blackhats_production/,True

post,1046cp8,🍿 The 954 Movies I saw in 2022 🍿,"This is the second year since I started writing short reviews of the many films that I watch every day. A year ago I wrote about seeing 885 movies in 2021. And here's the encore for 2022. *(All links are at the bottom of this post).*

Watching nearly 3 movies a day for 2 years is not exactly 'normal', and  neither am I. However, I'm a life-long cinephile who finally have the chance to do whatever the heck I want, and that's what I decided to do. I love discovering new works of art, as well as re-living forgotten memories of the past. It also got me back into the habit of writing every day, even if it's only short observations that go into my proverbial drawer.

Most important is the joy that the process gives me, so unless my circumstances change, I plan on continuing with this “Project” for the foreseeable third year.

**Below are some statistics and a few of my best finds from 2022:**

Of the 954 films that I saw, 121 (12%) were films I had seen before (often repeatably), and 833 were 'New watches.' 74 of them (8%) were documentaries, 74 were short films, 7 were stand-ups and 9 were 'so bad that I couldn't finish them'.

This year I wanted to explore even more of “World” Cinema, so I saw a total of 460 “foreign” films. They were broken into: French (76), British (71), Japanese (47), Korean (23), Swedish (22), Danish and Italian (21 each), Canadian (15), German (13), from Hong Kong (11), Russian (10), from Finland and Argentina (9 each), Iranian (8), Turkish and Czechoslovakian (7 each), Australian, Indian, Irish and Norwegian (6 each), from Iceland, Israel, Mexico (5 each), Austrian, Belgian, Kiwi and Spanish (4 each). Also multiple films from Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Egypt, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Indonesia, Lebanon, Macedonia, Nigeria, Palestine, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine and Wales. *Many of the movies I enjoyed the most came from these countries.*

As far as their age, there were only 32 silent films (before 1930), Only 77 'talkies' from 1930-1960, and 572 newer ones, from 2000 to today.

Of the individual directors, here are the ones I saw the most films of:

Hitchcock (12), Sang-soo Hong (8), Mike Leigh and Truffaut (7 each), Jodorowsky (6), 5 each from Antonioni, Steven Soderbergh, Wong Kar-wai, Rohmer, Aki Kaurismäki, Godard, Roy Andersson, Milos Forman and Bruce Beresford. And 4 each from Nuri Bilge Ceylan **(!)**, Orson Welles, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Abbas Kiarostami, Billy Wilder, Bong Joon-ho, Michael Haneke, J C Chandor **(!)**, Michel Gondry, Denis Villeneuve, Werner Herzog and Spielberg. >!(There are just too many good directors, and even more so 'bad ones'.)!<

In principle, I prefer films with strong emotional resonance, quiet films about real people in real “life situations”. I have no problem with 'slow cinema'. I also adore films that are very cinematic and well made, that are unique and original. I feed on art and culture, but not necessarily on 'artsy' films. On the other hand, there are many types of films that I usually avoid; horror, superheroes, blockbusters, supernatural, sci-fi, franchise, fantasy, most 'action', only some 'genre'. So my list is bent with that in mind.

Without further ado, here are a few of the new-to-me, less-obvious gems that I discovered this year. Known “classics” from the usual “Best Of Lists” are not included. This personal collection is picked at random, as there were around 60 films this year that I rated 10/10.

🍿

**Guys and Dolls** (1955), the surprising musical by A Joseph L. Mankiewicz, based on the stories by Damon Runyon, reminded me of a pastel-colored Jacques Demy bonbon.  From [its opening titles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm6nQSoLfWY), to the [sexy Miss Adelaide And Her Alley Kittens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVWuKaEPmYs) number, and to [Brando himself singing and dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii2gQI8WA7I), it kept me enchanted for 2.5 hours straight. Brando establishes many of Vito Corleone’s mannerisms in super-cool gambler Sky Masterson personality.

🍿

[*2 women, waiting for the bus, recognize each other. One of them apologizes to the other for something she did years ago, when they were in school. The other one says that she forgives her, and then leaves on foot.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnf3eWOfEPQ)

This is one of 56 short, unrelated vignettes, all told quietly as a series of static shots, in Icelandic Rúnar Rúnarsson‘s meditative **Echo (2019)**. Snippets of stories, with no thematic connections between them, except that they all happen in Iceland during Christmas. Clearly influenced by Roy Andersson, (especially his ‘Pigeon Sat On A Branch Reflecting On Existence‘) and just as moving.

🍿

Iceland has only 370,000 people, and they make about 10 films per year. But their cinema is terrific, including films by Baltasar Kormáku. His **Virgin Mountain** (2015) is a delicate and realistic story about Fúsi, a middle-age man, fat, bald, shy and lonely who’s still a virgin living with his mom. When he receives a birthday gift of line-dancing lessons he meets another lonely soul, a blond who suffers from depression and they starts a fraught relationship. Kormáku's series **‘Trapped**’ is also recommended.

🍿

One of the most unusual films I’ve never heard of, **Lost in London**, an audacious directorial debut. A Woody Harrelson production, written by him, directed by him, headlined by him and recreating [“the worst night of his life from 2002”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEnlNGDhIPs) Also, it was shot in a single take with one camera, and was live-broadcasted to over 550 theaters at the same time as it was shot, on January 19, 2017. On top of all that, it was an heartfelt roller-coaster with a great confessional story, and was so funny that at 2AM my 92-year old mom woke up next door and burst into my bedroom, when - forgetting where I am - I loudly screamed (at the shocking vomit scene at the club toilet). A technical marvel! (Also, I didn’t know that he was a serious Chess player).

🍿

I was delighted to discover a few excellent Lebanese films. Director Ziad Doueiri's **West Beirut** was his extremely well-made 1998 debut film. It starts on April 13, 1975 when a busload of 31 Muslims were massacred by masked terrorists, right in front of the protagonist’s school. This real event sparked the civil war that divided Beirut into Christian East Beirut and Muslim West Beirut. Surprisingly warm and authentic story about two high-school friends who wake up one day to find themselves in a war zone.

Shout-out also to his later film '**The Insult**', to George Peter Barbari's brilliant debut '**Death of a Virgin and the Sin of Not Living**', and to '**Heaven without people**' by Lucien Bourjeily.

🍿

*How is it possible that you could recognize a piece by Ennio Morricone by hearing the first note?* asks Hans Zimmer in **Ennio: The Maestro** from Giuseppe Tornatore. Morricone, the most popular and prolific film composer of the 20th century, was so much more than a film composer. This documentary makes a strong assertion that he was actually one of the greatest film-makers that ever lived.

🍿

One of the many films with a score by Morricone that I saw for the first time was Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 **The battle for Algiers.** Classic anti-colonialist, a powerful neorealist piece about the Algerian revolution and the guerrilla war for independence from the cruel occupying French regime.

🍿

*""...Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man”…*  I finally got to watch all 9 films of the riveting British **The Up series**, “one of the most important documentaries ever” This once-every-seven-years project, which followed the lives of a random group, 10 boys and 4 girls, from 7 to 63, was captivating from the very beginning, and I binged it in 2-3 days. What started as a one-off sociological study of the British class system, turned into a philosophical process of observing change in real time. >!It got me to think: If somebody summarized my life in a similar fashion, I would appear to distant viewers as a complete and unpredictable freak.!<

🍿

Yasujirō Ozu's **Equinox Flower** and **Floating weeds**. Roger Ebert wrote about Floating weeds: *“Sooner or later, everyone who loves movies comes to Ozu. He is the quietest and gentlest of directors, the most humanistic, the most serene.”* My promise to myself for 2023: Go over his entire canon.

🍿

A new discovery for me was the works of “Kogonada”, who was inspired to chose his pseudonym from a screenwriter who frequently had worked with Ozu. His dreamy debut feature, **Columbus** (2017) was an intimate, modern Ozu-adjacent  tale about spaces, deep and quiet and emotionally fraught. Strangely, I looked for it on movie-lists for architecture nerds, and didn’t find it on any. Pure & unforgettable. He wrote it and edited it himself, beautifully.

🍿

When I studied film at the University of Copenhagen in the late 70′s, I picked Michael Cacoyannis’ classic masterpiece **Iphigenia** (1977) as the topic of my final paper. Iphigenia is one of the original Greek tragedies by Euripides, and the film is still as magnificent as it was 45 years ago. With unforgettable score by Mikis Theodorakis. **10/10.**

🍿

*“Grégory il a fait boum!”…* François Truffaut magical **L'Argent de poche** ([**Small Change**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALOiRV6QvJs)) has not only always been my all-time favorite movie about children, and my favorite Truffaut movie (Even more than his ‘400 blows’ and ‘The last Metro’) - it’s probably one of my top 50 films of all time. With another 2-second Truffaut cameo at the beginning.

🍿

Because I don’t watch nearly any SciFi movies, I can’t tell how innovative the 2018 Swedish **Aniara** high-concept adaptation is, but for me it was amazing: Philosophical, poetic and unusual, it reminded me of [Ingmar Bergman existentialist dramas - in space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG41Q_5DrA). A luxurious spaceship carrying settlers to Mars is knocked off course, and is destined to fly indefinitely toward interstellar space. Based on a 1956 book-length epic science fiction poem written by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson.

🍿

But my favorite science fiction film of all times is **World of tomorrow**, Don Hertzfeldt’s Oscar nominated mind-bending, surreal masterpiece.  American Icon and genius animator Don Hertzfeldt had uploaded to YouTube this “[One of the greatest short films in the history of movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PUIxEWmsvI)”.  It is about an innocent 4 year old girl who meets an absurd grown-up third-generation clone of herself contacting her from 227 years in the future. A lighthearted philosophical joke with deep, melancholic emotions.

🍿

**Everybody builds their own hierarchy of favorites. YMMV.**

🍿

If anybody wants to read my short, rambling weekly reviews, you can find them on [my tumblr blog](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/tagged/movies). I write about 20 movies every Monday: No need to like and subscribe.

Here is [my 2021 summery](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/post/673340622715944960/).

post,wm52tn,Executive Decision (1996) is a really well made action thriller,"best known as the movie where Steven Seagal dies about 45 minutes in. However, the movie has more virtue than than that and I think is an underrated and overlooked action thriller which did average box office business and was overshadowed by the similar themed Air Force One which came out the following year. While that film is pretty much a non stop action ride, this one is more of a thriller relying on the build up of tension and suspense as the characters sneak around a jumbo jet full of hostages trying to defuse a bomb and figure out how to dispatch of the hijackers. It's kind of like Speed mixed in with a Jack Ryan movie. Kurt Russell, who was known for playing tough guy types mostly, plays against type as the mild mannered CIA analyst and does a great job showing his range as an actor. David Suchet is genuinely menacing as the main villain. Halle Berry is likable as a flight attendant who helps our heroes and character actors like Joe Morton, BD Wong, John Leguizamo, and Oliver Platt make up Seagal's team. The Seagal  death is also still a great early film twist though probably at the time disappointed his fans (yes he had them back then).  Movie has strong production values and talented people behind it. Produced By Joel Silver, with editor Stuart Baird making his directorial debut. Written by the Thomas brothers (Predator movies),  Shot by Alex Thompson (Excalibur, Alien 3,   Cliffhanger, Branagh's Hamlet), edited by Baird and Frank J Urioste (Robocop, Total Recall, Cliffhanger) and a score by the one and only Jerry Goldsmith


the movie is also eerily prescient, being about terrorists hijacking a plane and planning to crash it into Washington, 5 years before 9/11.  Unfortunately the movie has been edited for the blu ray release and likely HD version found on streaming sites with shots of the terrorists praying and holding the Quran edited out. A shame and really unnecessary as the film makes it clear these are radical fundamentalists and not representative of all of Islam.  Anyway check this film out if you haven't but if you want the unedited version you will probably have to find the DVD

>I was doing this thing called Executive Decision and I was supposed to play the sergeant to his captain. The first day of rehearsal, there was the director \[Stuart Baird\], Joe Morton, B.D. Wong, Oliver Platt—we’re all big actors, we’re all big boys, we’re all experienced. And we start rehearsing and he came in and was like, \[low, breathy voice\] “I’m in command. What I say is law.” So I started, like, \[snorts\]. I mean, who the fuck talks like that? Who comes into rehearsal and says that shit? So I started laughing and he slammed me with an aikido elbow against a brick wall and knocked all the air out of me. I dropped to the ground, and all I could say was, \[gasping\] “Why? Why?” I really wanted to say that he runs like a bitch and has no hair, but I was afraid. \[Laughs.\] So on the days when we shot the scene where he died, I showed up so early. I wanted to see him die. It was like a fantasy.",WornInShoes,movies,64,,2022-08-12 02:30:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wm52tn/executive_decision_1996_is_a_really_well_made/ijxzyor/,False
comment,ijya45b,,"It, along with Under Siege, is probably among the best Die Hard-clones during the 90's.

Kurt Russell basically perfects the ""underdog everyman"" persona throughout the movie. 

Its like Jack Ryan, the military guys don't respect him. Nobody believes his theories. When the infiltration goes wrong, everybody is panicking, and the military guys want to raid the plan without accounting for the bomb.

A whole bunch of little problems are going off all over the place, and Kurt Russell keeps it together and convinces everybody to try and solve each of these problems, as they are occurring.

Fantastic character actors who all play their part well, Joe Morton, Oliver Platt, John Leguizamo. The pilots who realize that there's soldiers on the plane. Halle Berry participating in her heroics.

I didn't know who David Suchet was at the time, I didn't know that he was a fantastic british actor who made all of those Agatha Christie's Poirot movies, and is considered by many to be the quintessential Poirot. But his character in Executive Decision felt very smart, quite calculating, and just the right amount of evil and fanaticism. The other bad guys felt like followers. I think the movie did a good job showing some of the terrorists acting unsure, or a big jittery throughout the movie. They were operating on following their religious belief and their leaders. They mostly wanted their demands met, to get out of there alive. They didn't know David Suchet's character was going to have other plans.

The movie is better than the sum of its parts. The only thing I would consider a flaw is that, since its a movie taking place in a plane, they have to add a tense plane landing scene at the end. It probably didn't need that.

Very rewatchable movie.",donsanedrin,movies,23,,2022-08-12 03:54:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wm52tn/executive_decision_1996_is_a_really_well_made/ijya45b/,False

Yeah they had a contract but obviously you can cancel that when there's real sexual harassment. Exit Wounds was a project that they actually wanted him for. It was a big production.

There are NO credible sources for anything that's on the Imdb Trivia for this movie regarding Seagal.

Seagal is the kind of guy that wouldn't be forced out of a movie. He would never let that happen, and it didn't happen. It was always the intention to kill him off early. This has been said in interviews over the years, you can Google that easily. He's also photographed at the premiere of the movie along with the other stars.

post,u837nq,"Phantoms from 1998. A horror film with Ben Affleck in what is likely his first leading role, Rose McGowan, Liev Scheiber and the late great Peter O’Toole is a prime example of a film that starts solidly but falls apart by the end","an adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel and likely the biggest budgeted and most high profile. Probably the most notable thing about Phantoms is that it stars a young Ben Affleck in what is probably his first leading role and what is basically a footnote in his career. We also have actors like Liev Schreiber and Rose McGowan who were fresh off Scream and the late great Peter O'Toole who instantly brings a sense of class and credibility to the movie. The concept of this film is honestly great blending haunted house type horror with creature feature type stuff that will remind of films like Carpenter's The Thing and The Blob remake and the first 40 minutes are actually solidly eerie, mysterious, and suspenseful. Unfortunately the film quickly goes downhill once we find out the true nature of the antagonist and then devolved into mumbo jumbo about petroleum jelly and a genuinely terrible climax. Too bad.  Maybe don't hire the director of Halloween 6 to make a movie with such a great concept. Not as bad as the critical reviews and an all right enough time waster but probably a prime example of a film that should be remade. Also, yes Affleck was da bomb in this movie",JannTosh12,movies,56,54.0,2022-04-20 18:35:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/u837nq/phantoms_from_1998_a_horror_film_with_ben_affleck/,True

post,rqn3o5,The Internet's 100 best-rated Film Productions of 2021,"Hi. I like statistics. Personal opinions are fantastic, but it always gives a nice overview about ""what's happening"" across the world with lists like these. So, I added up IMDb and mubi ratings (for the hype page and the snob page to be a bit mean :b) in order to get some better results. And yes, I know the title, but here you go, get TV shows too (though not as thoroughly researched outside of English languaged TV). :)

DISCLAIMERS: Given how new those films are, their ratings will change, and this is not meant as a final list but as a nice overview to share and discuss.

(Films in CAPSLOCK only have ratings on IMDb, films in *CAPSLOCK* have only ratings on IMDb and rated above 8.0 so that I removed 1 point. Indian films with only ratings on IMDb lower than 8.0 are in ***CAPSLOCK*** and lose 0.5 points. I started doing this for diversity's sake, because otherwise there'd be overwhelmingly many Indian films in the top 10 as people of the respective countries seem to have a different rating habit (comparable to the high discrepancy of MCU films between IMDb and mubi, *No Way Home* this year 8.9 / 6.8). If you feel like that's stupid, feel free to feel so, I marked them so that you can know what the actual ratings were. +1 for *THOSE* \+0.5 for ***THOSE***.

Interestingly, this year, there's also one non-Indian film affected by it:  Emergency Declaration with the fantastic Song Kang-ho and Lee Byung-hun, so you might want to bookmark that one. Which by no means means that the Indian ones aren't worth a watch, mind you!

I have also excluded anime films that are spin-offs or sequels to big shows such as the (undoubtedly genius) Gintama finale and the Violet Evergarden movie as they are a special case.)

Enjoy!

Best TV shows/seasons, determined like so: \[mubi+(IMDb average+ratinggraph season average)/2\]/2 Doesn't matter if just the final or first episode was released in 2021. I do that since in later seasons, usually most people who didn't like it already stopped watching. This seems to be a bit better for the stats. If it's only one season, I didn't add the average episodes.

comment,hqe349n,,"Well, the cinematographer is always the first to check out. Autumn Durald is not famous, but she has been noted as a remarkable cinematographer in 2014 already by both Indiewire and Variety. Her projects are often praised for cinematography, as small as they are. Disney obviously noted.

Of course the director also plays a part, especially in the concept of shots and such, if you will. Mr. Robot's cinematographer, Tod Campbell, is even more unknown, but he had done that work in Mr. Robot and Stranger Things. The scenes where Loki and Mr. Robot seem most similar seem to be those where Loki is a bit darker. Lightning can make or break a scene, but if you have someone who understands creating it and someone who understands how to frame or utilize it, you get some fabulous pictures.

Now, on a few anecdotal side notes as I haven't seen much of Loki. Maybe something helps you.

TV shows didn't even have the budget for cinema-like cinematography, but as shows such as True Detective, Game of Thrones, The Leftovers and Mr. Robot showed, that's in the past. Loki, of course, probably had all the money it needed.

VFX is a different story altogether. It started to get worse around 2011 due to CGI being so modern that studios just didn't use point of references anymore, hence why The Hobbit looked worse than LotR in 2012 already even though Jackson is a sucker for technology. You can make it look good if you are a MCU film, though even there it sometimes is lacking. Mandalorian did that notably differently with its little green star because, as it is told, Werner Herzog called them pussies for not doing it with a puppet. And doesn't he look realistic as fuck? Realistic lightning doesn't have to be unnecessarily and often obviously fakey recreated and you, in that case, even have something that's clearly touchable.

Then there's cases such as Jurassic Park vs Jurassic World, where you not only have a Spielberg valuing point of reference more (I think), but a team who just sets the whole CGI that happens outside into the night to have a much easier time to make it look realistic (not to mention they also used a lot of puppets). :) Infinite tricks up the sleeves of experts.",upsawkward,movies,3,,2021-12-29 09:11:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rqn3o5/the_internets_100_bestrated_film_productions_of/hqe349n/,True
comment,hqe1ubo,,"I agree that IMdb is untrustworthy, but the mix of IMDb and mubi has been quite cool.  rottentomatoes has not enough ratings with international films, and letterboxd is a bit better, but also very hypey (and has also often not enough). I always check mubi ratings first, but they are *all* about the craft and I sometimes rather enjoy something sweet merely to have fun with my favorite actors, like Transformers. So ratings are only fine if you perceive them as what they are; not final, but nice orientations, and, of course, culturally telling.

I stopped to feel stressed by it. In fact, ever since I started to watch mostly 1950s and 1960s films, I stopped caring to be up with the hype. You won't ever watch all the masterpieces of the past, if you always worry about the new ones, you'll miss out big. But of course the missing out mindset is not healthy in and of itself. I think of it like people - there's billions of people in the world, and undoubtedly millions of which I'd love to meet. But life is life, and it's less about knowing them all rather than sharing an experience with some that will inevitably also connect you with others. But I'm a romantic. :)",upsawkward,movies,3,,2021-12-29 08:54:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rqn3o5/the_internets_100_bestrated_film_productions_of/hqe1ubo/,True

comment,hqewiz1,,"Now that finally we have a much more diverse film landscape, why not give the actor his power instead of some skin colors? It's Macbeth, not Braveheart. It's character-driven with witches and not a story of true Scottish history. Especially in theatre where that's normal anyway, but, in general, who cares? Wouldn't it also be narrow-minded to hate Hamilton for having a diverse cast even if you loved it before seeing the actors?

It's art. Who cares about race? The reactionary idea of ""but then whitewashing doesn't exist"" is just naive considering how only 20 years ago a non-white actor had nearly no chance of a film role outside of a stereotype in big productions.

comment,hqg0w1h,,"If nobody cares about race why go out of your why to cast so many actors of different races and gender in the first place?

Because... one, they didn't have the chance before. As I said. Denying that is odd. Just like middle-aged+ women by the war, who very slowly could get a career going in television during the 2000s and now start to get their own films. Second, and more importantly, because they suit the artist's vision more, and Denzel Washington is a *perfect* match of Macbeth.

I'm counting through the IMDb real quick. In the decades up to the 1980s, black actors weren't even in 10% of the 200 most popular films as main roles. Rose to 10% in the 90s, 20% in the 2000s and 30% in the 2010s and 2020s, the latter having by far more films with sometimes even exclusively black actors. The number would be even higher if I had also counted other minority groups and substracted international films which got also more popular, so it's probably more at 40%, but you get the point.

I doubt I have to tell you how many black people were given Academy Awards over the course of time and how many white peeps. The range of black actors, especially smaller ones, took the old numbers to shame, and now you not only not have one quota strong black guy but more who aren't defined by stereotypes or the popularity of their actor names. Of course there were famous black actors, Hollywood typecasted Denzel Washington, SLJ, Will Smith & Co. for decades. Which is fine, they are fantastic, but do you really think a C-class black actor had much of a chance? But, assuming you aren't denying the structural racism that has been big in the USA, pushing this diversity for the last decade has been a blessing for cinema. So many more faces no matter their ethnicity. I think we're getting to a time where it doesn't matter if the cast is all white or all black - which suits the film the most, the artistic decision rather than the producer being like ""uhhh... but black female protagonists won't sell shit.""

Now criticizing a film with a Denzel Washington for an originally white role (or Dev Patel in The Green Knight, whatever) seems extremely petty. If it pulls you out of immersion, fine. (Never go to the theatre though.) But calling it blackwashing is reactionary BS.",upsawkward,movies,3,,2021-12-29 19:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rqn3o5/the_internets_100_bestrated_film_productions_of/hqg0w1h/,True

post,qup5u6,Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Licorice Pizza' Review Thread,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/licorice_pizza): 100% (9.20 in average rating) with 15 reviews

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/licorice-pizza): 95/100 (12 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> At its best, Licorice Pizza demonstrates a lightness of touch that hasn’t been so evident in Anderson’s work since Boogie Nights, nowhere more so than in the fabulously lived-in scenes with Alana and her family, played to considerable amusement by Haim’s actual sisters and parents. But the thrilling propulsion of Boogie Nights is matched here only in fits and starts. The movie, particularly in its meandering second hour, often leaves you wondering where it’s going, more in frustration than curiosity.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-anderson-1235047705/)

> In “Licorice Pizza,” time isn’t something that keeps people apart — it’s the only thing that allows them to find each other in the first place. And this euphoric movie doesn’t waste a minute of it.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/11/licorice-pizza-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1234679385/): A

> This is lighter and sunnier than previous Anderson pictures; subtract the porn and indeed the sex from ""Boogie Nights"" and you have something like it; remove the metaphysical anxiety from ""Inherent Vice"" and that comes reasonably close, too. It’s such a delectable film: I’ll be cutting myself another slice very soon.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/15/licorice-pizza-review-paul-thomas-anderson): 5/5

> There’s an extraordinary ensemble here, but it’s these two untried leads who elevate “Licorice Pizza” to the joyful, engrossing experience that it is. It’s certainly of a piece with Anderson’s filmography — the romanticism of “Punch-Drunk Love” meets the terrain of “Boogie Nights” — but it’s altogether a one-of-a-kind delight from a daring and always-surprising filmmaker.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/licorice-pizza-review-paul-thomas-anderson-alana-haim-cooper-hoffman/)

> In a world of algorithmically sorted content, Anderson’s ninth film, and his first since 2017’s Phantom Thread, is irresistibly hard to pin down: you’d have to go back around 50 years, to the likes of Hal Ashby’s Shampoo or Peter Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture Show, to find another that runs on a similar kind of woozy clockwork.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/licorice-pizza-review-screwball-meandering-feels-seductively/): 5/5

> As a title, Licorice Pizza suggests something revolting, a mix of the medicinal tang of anise and the greasy salt of a cheap slice. If that were the intended association of the filmmaker, Paul Thomas Anderson, it wouldn’t come as a surprise. Over his brilliant, wandering career, Anderson has shown us plenty of scuzz and grime, alongside flashes of kinetic verve and primordial howl. But Licorice Pizza is, by some measure, his most deliberately pleasant film to date. It’s a lively, messy coming-of-age story which turns the clashing elements of its title into reflections of a certain youthful folly and daring, a penchant for base gross-out humor and big, revolutionary thinking. Licorice on pizza? Why not, when you’re young and feeling free?

-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/11/licorice-pizza-is-paul-thomas-andersons-kindest-gentlest-movie-yet)

> Licorice Pizza delivers a piping-hot, jumbo slice-of-life look at how it felt to grow up on the fringes of the film industry circa 1973.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/licorice-pizza-review-paul-thomas-anderson-alana-haim-1235110340/)

> It should be said, it’s possible normies, and non-PTA devotees won’t want to worship at the altar of this somewhat rootless and musing film and some traditionalists might leave feeling a little bewildered by its slack structure. But if you’re open to its unconventional, idiosyncratic flavors, “Licorice Pizza” is a wonderfully wistful and evocative ode to youth, done by a masterfully poised filmmaker who doesn’t really care if this ain’t your bag. All our welcome and invited, of course, but PTA’s mellow and balmy effort feels like it’s enjoying itself too much to care if you haven’t caught on to its whole-hearted drift.

-[Rodrigo Perez, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-anderson-review-20211115/): B+

> The plot of this movie doesn’t matter because it barely has one, even though it’s incredibly entertaining. Part of me thinks Anderson saw ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and thought, ""huh, yeah, I can do something like that"". And, frankly, if all our current upper echelon filmmakers want to try their hand at movies like this, I’m all for it. But, in the end, this is a movie with heart and emotion. Something Anderson hasn’t seemed too interested in over the last 19 years. Maybe it got all stored up in there, somewhere, and he had to let it all out. Maybe it forced its way out. Regardless, what emerged was Licorice Pizza.

-[Mike Ryan, Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/movies/licorice-pizza-review/)

What's the significance of the age gap? You might as well pretend that the 15-year-old is an adult because the movie does its best to make you forget he's not. Lots of pandering cameos and 70s nostalgia.

comment,ho7jxkw,,"Just saw it tonight. I'm fully prepared to be downvoted and I'm certainly in the minority, but I was not a fan of this movie at all. The movie makes a huge point of the age gap then spends 2 hours trying to make you forget that the two main characters are in a toxic, pedophilic relationship. That's a big fucking ""yikes"" from me.

I was half expecting it to maybe address that at some point but nope, the movie expects you to be okay with that because they're in love. Um?

I'm guessing this movie wouldn't be so popular if it was a 25 year old man entertaining and eventually pursuing a 15 year old girl. I don't really care what you think about a film being ""realistic"" or whatever, if a film is going to include such a massive age gap it needs to seriously address why it's doing that. This film doesn't. It just focuses on their love and expects you to be fine with that.

On top of that, I found it at best, boring. For a movie that's just trying to show you a slice of someone's life, nobody in this movie talks like a normal human being. It felt like every line was written by a film student. There wasn't a single scene in this movie where I felt immersed or felt I could suspend any kind of disbelief.

The cinematography was fine I guess? They did a good job capturing the 70s but that's about the extent of my praise for that.

It just felt disjointed and boring on top of being problematic at its core. Maybe it's just not my kind of movie but that's my hot take. I expected way more from the amount of praise it was getting.

Extra hot take: this feels like the kinda movie people say they enjoy so they can appear quirky and unique, not because they actually enjoy it as film.",thekingofthejungle,movies,52,,2021-12-12 04:33:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qup5u6/paul_thomas_andersons_licorice_pizza_review_thread/ho7jxkw/,False

It felt very disconnected and repetitive. 25 year old is so insecure that she jumps into the arms of every man, and ***every*** man she meets wants to have sex with her. Rinse, repeat.

Characters also felt all over the place, whether it be Alana or Sean Penn and Tom Waits motivating a restaurant to leave their enjoyable dinner to come watch someone ride over a small pit. This goes on for way to long, and barely has any pay off, that couldn't have been achieved in a quicker or more satisfying way.

Alana also goes from trusting Gary enough to show him her breasts, to the very next scene, berating him while explaining the necessity for oil in his business. Like I get you (Gary) pine for the older girl because to you, she is the ultimate unachievable, but she goes from guy to guy on a whim, irrespective of their age, despite Gary's well known feelings for her, and she's not particularly nice to him.

One of my fav segments was the one with Sean Penn and Tom Waits. 
Some people in the theater audibly groaned at the racially insensitive scenes but I do think it was reflective of the period.

comment,hqi8yl3,,"Just saw this today and really enjoyed this one. Great performances by Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman. Bradley Cooper as Jon Peters was hilarious and terrifying. And I love how seamless Greenwood's score blended in with the film. I feel like PTA brings the best out of him each time they collaborate. 

To preface, I don't read film reviews. And I've yet to read any recent PTA interviews. So all the controversy mentioned in this thread about the age-gap is new to me. IMO, I feel like PTA did a great job of directly addressing their age gap throughout the film. I think Alana and Gary's recurring convo regarding age and Alana's scene with her sister, expressing her discomfort with the age gap, cemented the impression in my head that the romantic angle to their relationship doesn't last too long after the credit ends (and that the audience and director know them having sex isn't appropriate/isn't likely to happen given Alana's expressed misgivings).

The film consistently demonstrates that Alana is struggling to transition into adulthood (her photo job that's basically a teenager's job,  her inability to reconcile religious differences btw herself and the actor guy, her brief 'relationship' with Jack Holden which literally knocked her on her ass (as well as her admitted inexperience with drinking), her quick, failed rebound with the dude at the mattress store grand opening, and the experience of seeing Joel Wach and his partner's tragic, hidden relationship).  It seems like she was consistently running away from the messiness of being an adult. In contrast is Gary a fun, warm place to escape to avoid real adulthood. Gary accepting her faux maturity, acting 'adult' himself by being an entrepreneur, semi-successful actor, and lounge regular all make their attraction (and likely separation weeks after the credits end) totally believable despite the age difference. Like so many irl relationships they're both exactly what the other person wants (but not what they actually need) at this time in their lives and they go for it.",dioscuri_,movies,3,,2021-12-30 04:28:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qup5u6/paul_thomas_andersons_licorice_pizza_review_thread/hqi8yl3/,False
comment,hrti5so,,"Posted this in another thread (unpopular opinion, but this is the kind of movie that mostly film critics would love):

Love PTA (you cannot put this movie in the same sentence with Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, that latter of which is consistently considered one of the best movies of this century, which I wholeheartedly agree with).  If this wins PTA his first Oscar it will be a shame.

First, the good. Haim is phenomenal, but her performance is wasted by a movie consisting of pointless ""anecdotes"" and apart from the falling in love story there isn't much of a plot or story there. Just one scene after another. Boring as hell. I almost walked out, but stayed out of my love/respect for PTA. Seriously. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.

The bad (there are a few bad reviews out there): there were so many scenes that were reminiscent of his other movies. Was PTA referencing himself? If he was, it did not work imo. Boogie Nights is all over this movie. Example. The scene when they are taping an ad for the politician there is a shot that is exactly the same as a shot from Boogie Nights (shot of the front of the camera with lens flare at the edge of the frame). Second, I know Cooper is Philip Seymour Hoffman's son, but imagine if Scotty J. from Boogie Nights had a movie about him when he was young. That was the vibe that I got from Cooper's entire performance and character.

Also, one Licorice Pizza promo posters is almost exactly the same as the Boogie Nights one (character surrounded by minor characters in circles, almost the same font).

Loved the Shabbat dinner blessing scene (I can relate to it), but otherwise this movie was Just terrible.",Maimonides_Mozart,movies,3,,2022-01-08 20:14:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qup5u6/paul_thomas_andersons_licorice_pizza_review_thread/hrti5so/,False

post,pjx1jm,What is your favourite teaser trailer of all time?,"From the moment Harry Knowles first sullied a keyboard with Cheeto dust, movies have struggled to maintain any mystery ahead of their release.

With the exception of a couple of very concerted contemporary filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan, these days it is easy for anyone who so wishes to find all manner of spoilers about a film months ahead of its debut.

And with that erosion, so too has the value of the humble teaser trailer been diminished. No longer is a wordless teaser trailer with a temp score enough to keep fans salivating and theorising for six months before the first full trailer.

Fans these days expect more, and can get more, so most studios barely put any weight behind teaser trailers any more.

It is a lost art.

And so I would love to hear what each of your favourite teaser trailers are. I will offer two, my favourite and the one that I think everyone will want covered…


**[The Raid](https://youtu.be/7KJ0N7ik3yI)**

There were multiple versions of teasers circulating before the film debuted outside of Indonesia, so the one I’ve chosen to attach is my personal favourite.

With a ruthless efficiency befitting Gareth Evans himself, the teaser lays out the film’s simple setup in a few title cards, giving the footage room to breathe under the pulsating score written for the international release by Mike Shinoda and Joe Trapanese.

When I say the footage breathes, I mean it roars… the trailer showcases the kineticism of Evans’ direction, the hardness of the hits taken by the Indonesian cast, the inventiveness of the action... Without a single word of dialogue, this teaser left me salivating in a way that very few teasers have before or since.

**[Star Wars](https://youtu.be/onikub5BaZU)**

No musings on the history of movie marketing can be complete without addressing the film that changed everything.

However, Star Wars didn’t get everything right first time. This teaser feels like Alan Ladd Jr had no idea how to market the film he had championed. The tone is horribly off, missing the fun, adventure, and chemistry between the leads that Star Wars is famous for, instead presenting the movie as a dour, soulless space epic.

comment,gyjxijd,,"I think your focusing on the wrong thing.

Casting has very little to do with box office  appeal.  It's not completely irrelevant but the main way movies cater to China is not putting things in the movie that the censorship board won't like.

You can't have excessive human violence so Deadpool was unable to be screened.  You can't depict certain religious themes and can't depict supernatural themes so basically no western horror movies make the jump.  And obviously nothing critical of the Chinese Gov.


In order to ensure they make the cut studios consult with Chinese producers on what to cut and add.  Hollywood has been self-censoring and making China-edits of blockbusters for years.  In Doctor Strange his teacher in the comics is a Tibetan monk but to avoid any displeasure from China they cast Tilda Swinton and made her Celtic.  They even will add scenes.  In the Avengers movies they had Steve Rogers use a Chinese brand of cellphone for a scene and apparently there's a scene from Iron Man 3  where Chinese doctors are shown healing Tony Stark.

Casting is an issue but it's generally not a huge deal.  

With that being said, movies like Mulan and Shang Chi are certainly made with big Chinese Box Offices in mind.

comment,gykzxcb,,"So was Black Panther trying to cater to the African market because it had a mostly black cast?

I ask this because most of the actors that you are saying are from ""China, Japan, Indonesia, etc"" are Asian American rather than merely Asian. Just like how most of the Black Panther actors are African American.

So why is Black Panther considered representation for African Americans, but Shang-Chi is considered pandering to China instead, when Marvel has made it clear they are making Shang-Chi as their ""Asian representation"" film?

I'm not saying you're racist or anything, I just want you to think about why you equate an all Asian cast to be pandering to China more than any other Marvel movie. People subconsciously see Asians as a ""perpetual foreigner"" and do not see them as truly American, and I think you are making this judgment subconsciously here.

Asian American representation is lacking even more than African American representation, so there's a big reason why they are making this movie that has nothing to do China. So you should think of this more of them pandering to the woke SJW crowd rather than for the Chinese box office, because it certainly hasn't been well received in China anyway.",candyissweet,movies,2,,2021-05-18 16:01:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/nf5g7o/is_there_a_sudden_increase_in_hollywood_movies/gykzxcb/,False

Bad example. I'm guessing you've never seen the series. Han was originally in Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift and has become an extremely popular character. He was also in Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, and Fast & Furious (though only in the beginning). These all being set before Tokyo Drift.

post,lbxnrj,What films were you expecting to hate but ended up enjoying or vice versa?,"What films were you dreading going into but ended up being surprised by and what films were you hoping to love but ended up extremely disappointed in? 

Here are some of my own:

-Expected to hate but loved:

1) Ted

I have avoided this film for as long as I have known of its existence. I remember seeing red band trailers back in the day consisting of a Teddy bear boning a prostitute in a stock room. It struck me as a film that is full of crude inappropriate humor simply for the sake of being crude and inappropriate with no real thought put into it. However, I decided to read the synopsis one day and I was slightly intrigued. I thought it was going to be about a guy who wished for his Teddy bear to come alive as a kid but that he got his wish granted AFTER he grew up. Okay, there are comedic possibilities to be had with that. Granted, that's not what happened but I was still pleased with what it was. Actually funny with some heart to it as well. 

2) Saw

I've always been weary of horror. There are a few classics that I make exceptions for but I have always steered clear of jumpiness and gore. All I've ever heard about the Saw series is that it's torture porn. One day I thought to myself, you'll never know what you can handle without being a little adventurous. So I put in the first one and, it was pretty cool. I already knew all the twists and Cary Elwes' American accent was horrible, but the story held up and the gore wasn't that bad. They alluded to it more than showed all the details. If this was a book, I'd be all over it. 

3) Cars 2

Everyone says that this is the worst Pixar film. I went into it expecting pointless stupidity, but that's not really what I got. It was still the same lovable characters from the first one. I expected Mater to be annoying as hell but he was pretty cute and his friendship with McQueen was the heart of the film. Yeah the spy angle is kind of dumb but for a dumb concept they went all the way with it and actually utilized in a way that made sense for this universe of sentient cars. Mater's not just played for laughs, he actually has character development and I enjoy this one just as much as the other two films. 

4) Solo

Gotta be honest, I never truly got into SW. As I've grown, I have a newfound admiration for them and from a storytelling standpoint, they tie together well. I really enjoy Rogue One NOW, but when I first saw it I was bored out of my mind. It was a bunch of space politics and Force mumbo jumbo and felt like a film tailored towards fans rather than a general moviegoer. Han Solo is fine but I've never been all that invested in his character. So I went into the film not expecting much. I know this is SW blasphemy but... I think this is actually my favorite one. It wasn't about space politics or Jedi mythos, it was just a fun heist film. Interesting characters, interesting set up, and extremely unpredictable. My type of film. 

-Expected to love but hate:

1) Captain Marvel

After seeing the trailers, I was all over this film. I was more excited for it than Endgame if you can imagine that. Boy, was I in for a rude awakening. The first time around, I was trying to convince myself I liked it. The worlds were cool, there were funny moments, but for some reason I had this feeling of anger in the pit of my stomach that I couldn't place. Why? After watching it over again, I finally realized what it was. Carol is a wooden lead, a feminist icon but nothing more, Fury's backstory that had been building up for years was thrown away as a joke, and the film was a clear allegory for the liberal view on immigration. I've never felt so betrayed or manipulated after seeing a film. Now I can't watch it at all without those feelings resurfacing. 

2) Ted 2

After the surprise of the first one, you bet I watched the second one. There are probably two scenes I liked in the whole film (when Ted and Tami-Lynn were first married, and John's revenge prank at the end). Everything else was exactly what I thought the first one was going to be. Crude inappropriate humor just for the sake of being crude and inappropriate and wasn't that funny. The romance plot was forgettable. I like Seyfried fine but she couldn't replace Kunis as female lead. Wahlburg and Kunis just had this chemistry he and Seyfried couldn't replicate and I wasn't at all invested in the character's relationship. 

3) Mulan (remake) 

Talk about so close yet so far. Like Captain Marvel, the trailers were so promising. They weren't just going to rehash the original, they were going to throw some witchcraft in, take a more serious approach, and be more faithful to Chinese culture. I was here for it. But also like Captain Marvel, it was just another feminist Mary Sue flick that didn't accomplish near what the original did. Like Larson, the actress was flat, the emotion wasn't there. The action ranged from kind of cool to weak. The message was stupid, and in an attempt to make the character stronger they made her weaker. So glad I watched it on a friend's account for free. I can not imagine wasting $20 on that garbage. 

4) Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears

I love Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. It's one of my favorite shows that I binged the crap of when it was on Netflix. Once I heard they were making a film, I was over the moon. After seeing it, I don't recall anything after the first ten minutes. Why the first ten minutes? Because they just completely retconned the finale of the show that was perfect. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the show but, it's disappointing. Also, most of the action is in the first ten minutes. The rest of the film was a boring waste of time that didn't add a thing to these characters that I love. They deserved better.",Olivebranch99,movies,0,64.0,2021-02-03 20:40:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lbxnrj/what_films_were_you_expecting_to_hate_but_ended/,True

I used to hate the MCU back in phase 1 because I was going through my hipster phase at the time, but I ended up getting dragged to the theaters to see Infinity War and I had a great time watching even though I hadn't been following the MCU for years. This made me go back and watch a lot of the older MCU movies and I found quite a few that are actually pretty great, especially Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy.

It's a slow burn, but it knew when to grab viewers by the throat as well.

post,l6mr6c,Is there an Asian IMDb???,"After watching most of the movies that Hollywood has to offer in the genres I like. I have made the hop across the Pacific into East Asia cinema. 

One of my favorite things to do after I've watched a film is to go on IMDb and read the trivia/goofs.

It is good insight into the behind the scenes of a movie, the characters, and the actors themselves.

For the most part Hollywood's movies are flooded with trivia, sometimes a little too much.

And when it comes to Asian films the trivia is practically non-existent. Or usually only has one or two unlike a Hollywood film which is like I said flooded with trivia.

**My question is: Is there a Asian site like IMDb that gives this type of info about a movie where people are adding trivia as they do on IMDb?** 

**Also can it be accessed in the US?** 

**And not just Chinese films but Japan, S.Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, & Thailand too?**

I cannot  begin to describe how infuriating and aggravating it is to watch a movie and be curious about the behind the scenes and the actors and to go onto IMDb and all it says is, ""Would you like to be the first to add trivia?"" Like NO! 

It makes it even worse when I go to Wikipedia to see if their is any Info on there for movie titles and there pages are empty too.

TL;DR: Is there a Asian IMDb site that offers trivia for all Asian films? If so can it be accessed in the US? Lemme know??

English speaking people don't give a shit about Asian films, for the most part.  English speaking people also happen to be the number 1 user base for IMDb.  

Check any other country's films.  I doubt there's much in the ""trivia"" sections of any other country's films outside of the US and Europe.

comment,gl1uhwr,,"I would totally do that if it was more specific.

I don't want a general book that talks about asian cinema and its differences and similarities to US cinema. While that would be interesting too I am looking for more specificity.

Like if there are books about certain movies and the behind the scenes aspect I would totally get those books.

For example on the trivia for **Detective Dee: Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010)** It has info like:

*""The stunt team built eight platforms (12 meters tall) in the cave for three days of wire work. The record was over 70 wires for one scene.""*

or

*""One of the sculptures was a 80- meter bust of Empress Wu Zetian, a key element of the film that cost $12 million to design and decorate. During production, reporters were invited to enter the bust's interior, which included a 12 meter tall circular platform. Outside of the platform hung red and white drapes that were full of scriptures.""*

comment,gb2j9hx,,"Here's a dumb tangent:

Last night on Cable I caught the very last episode of the goofy Hawaii-based TV series **Magnum, P.I.**

At the very end, the episode's final moments (along with the show's Production Company Logo and music sting) are seen as playing on somebody's television --which we then see is being watched by the show's star, Tom Selleck, out of character.  He smiles, points his remote control at ""us,"" the audience, and ""turns us off.""  The screen then goes black.",ZorroMeansFox,movies,1,,2020-11-04 01:53:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jnm0yi/movies_where_a_character_watches_the_final_act_on/gb2j9hx/,False

But also. As much as I love The Hurt Locker. I really do have an issue with TCM airing modern movies now. I don't expect this to be popular but I think they should have a hard cutoff at like 1978 tops. There's nowhere to see old movies except TCM. So many are not available to buy anymore or are spread across a bunch of damn 'services'. And the more and more they lean into modern movies which they do a lot more of now. The higher the chances are that they just become another AMC. Remember when that channel use to show old movies. Gone are those days.

comment,gaooiuu,,">And the more and more they lean into modern movies which they do a lot more of now. The higher the chances are that they just become another AC.

I understand that emotion. But they've been doing this since they started. Hell, the very first thing i can remember watching on the channel was the premiere showing of ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery."" (which I don't think they've ever repeated, btw.) And that was back when Bob Osborne had a card table and a folding chair as set design.

The thing was that it went with the theme of that particular evening (which was ""spy spoofs."")

""The Hurt Locker"" is part of the theme of its particular evening, which is  ""Movies directed by women throughout film history. (subset, Tension, Status, and Leave Out.)""

TCM is all about the themes and the grouping into same.

Also a generation is 20 years give or take. A film generally has to be a generation old before the (highly subjective) descriptor ""classic"" is applicable to it.

There's always more old than new on the channel, and as long as that remains evident, I'll keep on loving the channel.

No. A year or two back they aired a Sophia Loren short film from the year previous (as part of a night that featured the premiere of an interview done with her at the previous year's TCM Film Festival.)

post,incoay,10 Gems from Fantasia Fest 2020,"This year's digital Fantasia Fest is now over, and for once I got to see a buttload of films, thanks to a lot of movies being on VOD. I discovered a fair share of great Indie films I've never heard about before, and here are my recommendations;

\#10. [Slaxx](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9741310/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)  (2020) dir. Elza Kephart

>A possessed pair of jeans goes on a bloody rampage inside a trendy clothing store.

This is more of an honorable mention because this film was a bit of a disappointment. After seeing the trailer, I expected camp and gory scenes, but all the death scenes are shown in the trailer and most of the film is dedicated to a very on-the-nose social message (think late Romero). I have two suggestions, either don't watch the trailer and enjoy the film in its full camp, or go watch the trailer and enjoy it as a ""fake trailer"" kind of deal, all the fun is condensed in it anyway.

\#09. [A Mermaid in Paris](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9209312/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2020) dir. Mathias Malzieu

>In Paris, a man rescues a mermaid and befriends her, knowing that his heart will explode if he falls in love with her.

This one will probably be lost to time because it's too simple, despite having a lot of style.  I'll compare it to a pretty storybook; it has a very standard story, I always knew where it was going, but visually it's very creative, considering the low budget.  I'd recommend it to people who like fantasy in the same spirit of Del Toro's Shape of Water, but it's very far from the same quality, especially story-wise. At the very least, it's a cute romance.

\#08. [I WeirDo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12619256/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2020) dir. Ming-Yi Liao

>Two germophobes with OCD falls in love, but their relationship is put to test when one of them is cured from their condition.

Shot entirely with an iPhone, this was the second romance I watched in Fantasia and it was very good. The shots look very good, and the leads have great chemistry, which mean the romance part is top notch. I watched it as a fan of Asian cinema, so I'll recommend it mainly to anyone who also loves them, but I can't find myself recommending it further because the entire third act ruined the story for me, but here's to hoping you'll appreciate it more.

\#07. [Dinner in America](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9058654/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1) (2020), dir. Adam Rehmeier

>The singer of a punk band and a young woman obsessed with his band roams around the suburbs of 90s America, disrupting the lives of anyone they cross.

The film has that very Indie trait of ""we did our best with what we got"", and it shows mainly through the supporting cast and in the lackluster style, but the two leads are excellent, which is the most important thing in a romance, because it is somewhat of a romance. I think there's a bit more to the movie thematically, and I'm probably re-watching it in the futre.

\#06. [Yummy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11054164/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Lars Damoiseaux

>In an Eastern-European hospital for plastic surgery, a young couple is thrown into a bloodbath as zombies eat their way out.

A very classically-made zombie film: there're fun gory death scenes, a handful of characters that are killed off one-by-one to keep the film interesting, and good character-arcs for the protagonists. It doesn't do anything new, but it utilizes the genre well.

\#05. [Feels Good Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394182/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2020), dir. Arthur Jones

>Matt Furie, the creator of the comic Boy's Club, starts a battle against the Internet to take back his iconic character, Pepe the Frog.

This year's crowd pleaser, this documentary about the Internet phenomenon is actually very good. It shows Pepe's journey in the Internet through the years, and as someone who thought I knew everything, I learned more than I thought I would. It gives a whole other perspective on the situation, and it's really brought up by cool animated sequences. This is a must-see for anyone who's been on the Internet for a while.

\#04. [Fried Barry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9102084/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2020), dir. Ryan Kruger

>Barry is a drug addict and an abusive father, and he his body has been chosen as the vessel for an alien entity. As the alien goes on a bender on Earth, Barry is forced to watch from the backseat.

This was probably the most insane film in this year's program. Every 5 minute packs a shocking surprise and there's absolutely no way to know where the film is going, and through all of it I was impressed by how they managed to weave a story through it.  I don't really know how else to talk about the movie, but I can tell you that it's exactly like the trailer, perhaps even better.

\#03. [Jumbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6818118/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3) (2020), dir. Zoé Wittock

>Jeanne, a shy young woman who works at an amusement park finally falls in love when she meets Jumbo, the newest ride at the park.

Jumbo is a very obvious allegory about coming out, but it never hits you on the head with its message, rather, you very quickly warm up to the very strange concept of a girl falling in love with a theme park ride. It's the most ""artsy"" film I've seen in Fantasia Fest, so don't expect a weird campy film, it's played very straight and that's what makes it work. I believe it lost itself in the allegory near the end, but overall I really liked it.

\#02. [The Mortuary Collection](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7781432/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Ryan Spindell

>An old mortician tells four chilling stories about the strangest stories he encountered in his career.

A horror anthology that tells four stories set in four decades, from the 60s to the 90s. I surprisingly loved it: I'm used to seeing these anthologies fail, but for once all four stories are genuinely good, but my favorite part of the film is the very creative cinematography: I wasn't expecting it, but there are some very creative shots in the film, and that elevates it so much.

\#01. [Survival Skills](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8622348/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2020), dir. Quinn Armstrong

>A lost cop training video from the 90s, we follow the story of Jim, a fresh police officer, who's trying to resolve a domestic violence case outside the law.

The trailer makes it look like a horror film, but really Survival Skills is a very good drama. The overall idea is to put an idealistic cop character from a training video into the real, hard, cold world, and it works. At times it's very hard to watch because we're seeing our sweet boy being beat down by the real world. The filmmakers really nailed the style too, and I think that if any of you loves the aesthetic as much as I did, that's a must-see.",Faline-of-the-Forest,movies,61,10.0,2020-09-06 00:48:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/incoay/10_gems_from_fantasia_fest_2020/,True

1\. [Climate of the Hunter](https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/climate-of-the-hunter) (2019), Dir. Mickey Reece


But, let's face it: Fantasia is always excellent—there are so many good ones to choose from. Mortuary Collection was definitely a lot of fun. The only big disappointment for me was The Reckoning (2020, Dir. Neil Marshall). 

That's to say nothing of the amazing short films on selection. Some standouts, for me were, [Dead Birds](https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/dead-birds) (2018, Dir. Johnny Kenton); [A Cockerel's Tale](https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/a-cockerels-tale) (2019, Dir. Pei-Ju Hsieh); [A Million Eyes](https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/a-million-eyes) (2020, Dir. Richard Raymond); and The Guest (2015, Nicholas Rodgers — part of the [Wapikoni](https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/wapikoni) Mobile Collection).

comment,g48e5yz,,"I do, my username is Faline, but it's very new; I think there is a few genre and art films in my best of 2000 list, but I'll make you a list of recent films that I believe passed under the radar.

[Harpoon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7831358/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Rob Grant

>Three friends with a dubious friendship get stuck on yacht, where violence, grudges and sexual tensions erupt.

It's a black comedy survival film, it's not flawless but it gives you what you'd want from it: laughs, blood and desperate characters.

[Guns Akimbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6902676/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Jason Lei Howden

>In a world where people kill each other gladiator-style for an Internet show, one guy is chosen to battle the game's strongest player to save his ex-girlfriend.

It has Kick-Ass vibes, they're clearly attempting to be stylish, which shows half of the time, but mostly it was more of a ""I see what they were trying to do here"". If you don't expect anything more than Daniel Radcliffe with guns for hands trying to survive in a crazy world of violence, you'll probably be pleased.

[Swallow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8372298/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Carlo Mirabella-Davis

>A pregnant woman in a loveless marriage starts a strange addiction with eating dangerous objects, which destroys her relationship.

Not-Jennifer Lawrence stars in a very creative drama about being stuck in the mundane. The idea really works; I was cringing the whole time while she's swallowing nails and tacks, but the film is more than that too. It's an effective drama, but don't expect batpoo insanity, it's played very straight.

[Greener Grass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7422822/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Joceyln DeBoer

>Two mothers living in an idyllic suburb competes against each other in their personal lives as one of them sees her life stripped away from her.

A very surreal, Adult Swim-like black comedy about the suburbs. It IS funny and I absolutely think there's a chance it will be regarded as a cult classic in the future. The two ladies who directed it are hilarious, so if you like them I suggest you look at their short films (especially The Arrival)

[The Art of Self-Defense](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7339248/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Riley Stearns

>A wussy man becomes obsessed with his man-powered local dojo after being attacked on the streets.

Another black comedy, it's a good farce of both toxic masculinity and Karate dojos. It starts Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots, who are both great. Don't expect much fighting, it's very focused on Eisenberg's character and his transformation throughout the film.

[Little Joe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9204204/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Jessica Hausner

>Scientists create a flower that can make people happier, but a mother understand the implications of such a product when she gifts one to her son, who slowly turns into someone she doesn't recognize.

A very slow-paced horror, but it's one of the most effective I've seen recently. It's about artificial happiness and the implications of such a thing, it's part Body Snatcher, part ""is it really happening or is the protagonist insane?"". I really enjoyed it.

[Little Monsters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7390588/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Abe Forsythe

>A zombie outbreak breaks out during a kids' field trip, and a teacher, a washed out musician and a kids show personality must team up to survive.

I've never seen a bunch of kindergartens star in a zombie film, which is why this Lupita Nyong'o and Josh Gad film is really special. The zombie stuff is here and there, but it's an actually very cute film. Talk about a feel good zombie film.

[Avant qu'on explose](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9825006/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Rémi St-Michel

>A young boy who lives in rural Quebec tries to lose his virginity during the start of World War III.

An existential comedy about the anxiety of puberty. Lots of great ideas, plenty of uncomfortable scenes, and a handful of good jokes. 

[Extra Ordinary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8233874/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (2019), dir. Mike Ahern

>A retired psychic and a regular man haunted by wife tries to save a young girl from a washed up musician who made a pact with the devil to reignite his fame.

Extremely funny, that was an instant cult classic for me. Think a bit of Edgar Wright, because it IS a very well shot comedy.

post,hbsjon,Need Suggestions fro Bests Films from each country around the Globe. (A Compilation),"Hello!
I run an Instagram cinema page - mostly reviews and analysis. And for a while I've been thinking of taking up a challenge titled

'Around the World in 80 Films'

Basically I'd be watching and reviewing one film each from 80 different countries. This is to further increase my insight and knowledge of world cinema. Now, it's quite easy for me to pick a film from some of the most cinematically known countries such as Japan, India, Korea, Iran, the European big-shots. But that is hardly helping me cover more than 25 countries at the most.

So I would really appreciate any suggestions of movies from the lesser known countries around the world. 
Now since this is a huge undertaking for me, personally, it'd also be great if most of these movies are more easy for me to find. I have access to Netflix, Mubi and Criterion Channel... I'm willing to torrent - but ONLY as a last resort. So if your suggestions are more widely known/available then brownie points for that! :)

Also, time period is not an issue. I'm as open to watching a 1920s movie as a 2010s one. 
Animated films are also, of course, allowed. 
I'm willing to allow Documentaries too - but with a lower priority compared to a feature film. 

Anyway, here below is a list of the countries I've thought of covering.
 I'm willing to add and/or interchange if I'm missing out on something major.

Ill edit the list to include your suggestions if there are enough replies! :) 

Thank you for your input!

Every country around the world (except the US) is allowed to submit one film per year, as long as it is primarily in a language other than English. These are the movies that their home countries consider the best, so it's a pretty high quality list. 

I know that Wikipedia has the full list for every country going back at least a few years, maybe more.

I do believe that their official submissions aren't necessarily the best they have to offer.
For Non-European countries for instance, I've seen that films have to have a social commentary to even be considered.

comment,fswyyj9,,"I don't watch nearly enough foreign films, but I'm trying to remedy that. Here's a few that I've watched for the first time recently that I liked:

The Seventh Seal - I know I'm not breaking any ground by saying this movie is great, it's an iconic film. But what really surprised me was how funny it was.

Le Samourai - This one blew me away. If you like neo-noir you've got to check this out, it's a must-see.

Princess Mononoke - I've been working through Miyazaki's films and this one is by a wide margin my favorite of his. 

All of those are on HBO Max, and the former two are also on Criterion Channel.

post,fsyf9z,"The Jean-Claude Van Damme vs. Michael Myers jet ski chase in ""Halloween VIIII - Battle on the Bayou: Michael's Final Halloween"" covered 180 miles and they circled a tiny island 848 times during the four hour chase",">*Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween* *is what happens when you sneeze into a cheap tissue.* [***Roger Ebert (1996)***](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-blue-sea-1999)

Many of you remember [***Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween***](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/)as the film that ended the run of the *Halloween* franchise. In 1996, the series was reeling after the poor performance of [***Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers***](https://youtu.be/-v8l6cCrf0w)*,* and it was given one last shot to stay relevant in the evolving horror market. Knowing that the series needed a change, the producers and executives at Dimension Films decided to send Michael Myers to Louisiana to hunt the brother he never knew he had. In a major casting coup, Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast as Police Detective Chance Strode, the long-lost older brother of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). JCVD’s career had hit a rough patch after *Street Fighter, Sudden Death,* [***Drop the Beat***](https://youtu.be/q6ObhNBURyY) and [***Spin-Kick City*** ](https://youtu.be/i31XFSORRfc)failed to hit at the box office, so, desperate for a minor rebrand, he signed on to play the role for a lesser-fee with money promised on the back end.

&#x200B;

The producers at Dimension couldn’t afford to pay an established director, so they brought in stuntman legend and first-time director Steve Balsawood (stunts for *Lawrence of Arabia, Ghost*, [***Fire 2: Too Hot To Handle***](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo), and [***Backslap: The Movie***](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw)*)* to direct a script written by a young writer named Chuck Finley, who had written the well-received and commercially successful 1995 horror film [***Don’t Throw That Knife At Me!***](https://youtu.be/HsRwyJw5o7k). If there was one concern, it was that the movie had to go from script-to-screen in a mere six months, which meant the filming would commence without a finished script and locations that were not fully scouted or vetted.

&#x200B;

[Some concept art from the movie](https://preview.redd.it/ivsbttm6xnp21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3e482a9b77988f55184189f470762aa02aaec03)

&#x200B;

Desperate to bring in additional funding to beef up the $4 million budget.  The folks at Dimension signed a partnership with Yamaha to feature their X45 jet skis for a sizable amount that would help pay for the 23-day shoot. All was good until JCVD told the producers that he wouldn’t partake in any night shoots, which forced Finley and director Balsawood to revamp the script to make it a “day-time horror picture.” After several sleepless nights, and many unforgivable insults flung at each other, the two nailed down a script that played like a *Halloween* movie met *Nowhere to Run* and *Hard Target,* then completely forgot the *Halloween* angle\*.\* The highlight of the script was a jet ski chase that featured JCVD chasing down Michael Myers to make sure he can’t obtain the Spear of Destiny, which would make him even more immortal.

&#x200B;

[I never thought I'd see Michael Myers wear a suit while riding a jet ski.](https://preview.redd.it/ia6y4rmgxnp21.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcab33c5750ee079eb57c4a7725ca210b3d59aaa)

&#x200B;

Shooting began soon thereafter and everything quickly became a nightmare due to unreliable jet ski prototypes, infighting, terrible weather, rewrites, adultery, rampant drug use, scurvy, bad shellfish, impromptu crying sessions and budget cuts which you can read about in Balsawood’s book [***I Hated Directing That Movie***](https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg)*.* The rest is history, but one scene has always stuck with me and I finally decided to tackle it in hopes of making sense of it.

&#x200B;

[JCVD and a friend ride around for seven minutes talking about how great the jet skis are. ](https://preview.redd.it/fwcr41rcxnp21.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1067e66719a5db4a2b10d39f0a3e1015dd260e85)

&#x200B;

The following breaks down the incredibly random jet ski chase during the climax of the movie. I read in Balsawood’s book that they only had one day to shoot the scene and no locations to film the actual chase. So, the director, JCVD and a masked stuntman went out to a tiny island on the last day of principal photography and shot several hours of footage near the island. During their shooting, JCVD and the stuntman were only able to drive around the island 12 times due to the unreliable Yamaha X45 prototypes. Thus, the climax of the movie is centered around[ **two men driving around in circles**](https://youtu.be/gfXns_cU8I8).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A nice graphic of the chase](https://preview.redd.it/l9u2l57axnp21.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da18cabd1081bf0e85edb8f7293f1142f4fd8f8)

**Here are my assumptions:**

* They averaged 45 MPH during the entire chase
* They covered 180 miles during the chase
* They circled the tiny Louisiana island an estimated 848 times.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I know:**

I know a lot because the movie tells us everything

1. The movie has a [**36% Tomatometer score**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090759_deep_blue_sea), and it made [**$37 million at the international box office.**](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deepbluesea.htm) Surprisingly, it has a [**7.6 rating on IMDb.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149261/)
2. The X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.  We learn this when JCVD says “Wow, the X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.”
3. The rectangular island has a diameter of 360×160 feet and the best way to circle it on the jet ski is to stay 20 feet away from the shore (380×180 feet = 1,120 foot diameter). We learn this when Crazy Cajun Karl (Clint Howard) says “look for an island that is roughly equal to the size of a American foosball\* field….including the endzone. Make sure to circle twenty feet around the shore.”
4. The chase scene lasted four hours. I know this because during the scene JCVD yells “It’s almost been four hours and these X45 Yamahas are still running. What efficiency!”
5. The only person who can grab the “Spear of Destiny” is the man who fulfills a very specific prophecy. We learn this when Crawdaddy Kat (Kathy Bates) says “Only the man whose Yamaha jet ski runs of gas may grab the spear of destiny. He only can be stopped by a man who has run out of gas while riding the same exact Yamaha jet ski.”
6. The gas tanks were totally full. We know this because when Michael Myers and JCVD steal them, the gas station attendant says “Hey! I just filled them X45 Yamahas with gas!”
7. I know they circled the island because of the movies theme song, which peaked at number #78 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Charts in 1996. The song [**“Going in Circles” by Lit**](https://youtu.be/aFZtFoMX-EU), featured these lyrics “We’re going in circles, circles never stop because their infinite, much like Michael Myers.”

There you have it! JCVD and Michael Myers circled a tiny Louisiana island 848 times during their four-hour chase scene in *Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween.*

post,dlr883,'Terminator: Dark Fate' Review Thread,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_dark_fate): 65% (55 reviews) with 5.95 in average rating

> Critics Consensus: Terminator: Dark Fate represents a significant upgrade over its immediate predecessors, even if it lacks the thrilling firepower of the franchise's best installments.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/terminator-dark-fate): 55/100 (22 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> Dark Fate does offer a fair bit of pleasure to those wanting a 21st-century retread of T2. But it suffers greatly from obeying the imperative the first sequel established: Trying to blow minds and up the ante the way that FX-pioneering adventure did, this one offers a series of action set pieces that go from big to huge to ludicrous, even as the script's additions to fear-the-future mythology underwhelm.

-[John DeFore, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/terminator-dark-fate-review-1249238)

> It’s nice (and perhaps unavoidable) that the “Terminator” franchise has finally reached back into the past to remind us that tomorrow is always up for grabs — that the future belongs to anyone willing to fight for it. When the present is this dull, however, it can be hard to remember what anyone is supposed to be fighting for.

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/terminator-dark-fate-review-1202183832/): C-

> Despite Sarah Connor’s previous attempts and sacrifices, humanity’s fate is once again at stake — and with it the future of the franchise itself — in Terminator: Dark Fate. Tim Miller’s film deftly builds upon what worked in the first two James Cameron-helmed entities while bringing in a new host of characters and circumstances to challenge the course of humankind. While there’s definitely some frantic leap-frogging involved in terms of accepting why some characters have evolved the way they did, Terminator: Dark Fate ultimately succeeds in serving as both a suitable closing chapter for the original two films and a possible gateway to exciting new chapters ahead.

-[Jim Vejvoda, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/22/terminator-dark-fate-review): 8.0 ""great""

> Linda Hamilton makes a welcome return in a ‘true’ T2 sequel that doesn’t skimp on the action. But Judgment Day this ain’t.

-[Jordan Farley, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/au/terminator-dark-fate-review/): 3/5

> Easily the third-best Terminator film, which is more of a compliment than it sounds. It’s great to have Hamilton back in this role, but she’s ably matched by Reyes and Davis.

-[Helen O'Hara, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/terminator-dark-fate/): 4/5

> Dark Fate doesn’t offer any of its characters even that most temporary, and deluding, of comforts. It’s all bad. It always has been. And, quite gloomily, always will be.

-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/terminator-dark-fate-review)

> ""Dark Fate"" earns its favorable judgment by cleverly and effectively adding to that legacy. The only drawback is that accomplishment merely makes it more likely that in one form or another, sooner or later, yep, they'll be back.

-[Brian Lowry, CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/22/entertainment/terminator-dark-fate-review/index.html)

> It’s good to see Hamilton getting a robust role, although, sadly, she has to concede badass superiority to Davis. This sixth Terminator surely has to be the last. Yet the very nature of the Terminator story means that going round and round in existential circles comes with the territory.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/23/terminator-dark-fate-review-james-cameron-linda-hamilton-arnold-schwarzenegger-cyborg): 2/5

> “Deadpool,” which I’m a huge fan of, is his only previous feature, and Miller’s mastery of the physics of action reverie in that movie — to the point that he could dazzle you with the ballistics of combat and deconstruct them at the same time ­— was rather awesome. In “Dark Fate,” he doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but his weaponized clashes are gripping, never more so than when they’re on wheels, or (at the climax) on a dueling set of jumbo planes. What has changed in the 28 years since “T2” is that the rise of comic-book films has made the battle of borderline indestructible titans something we see in the movies more weeks than not. “Deadpool” was technically part of the “X-Men” universe (though the title character’s satanic-bitch sense of humor was a superior force to almost any power possessed by those mutants), and “Terminator: Dark Fate” could almost be about an evil offshoot of the X-Men — stalking robots who convert to metal and back again. But “Dark Fate,” if anything, comes close to being the “Logan” of that series. It’s a heavy-metal fantasy with a heart that, astoundingly, isn’t made of tin.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/terminator-dark-fate-review-linda-hamilton-arnold-schwarzenegger-1203377138/)

> Whether “Terminator: Dark Fate” is the last chapter in this story or the first in an all-new franchise is, for now, irrelevant. The film works either way, bringing the tale of the first two films to a satisfying conclusion while reintroducing the classic storyline, in exciting new ways, to an excited new audience. It’s a breathtaking blockbuster, and a welcome return to form.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/terminator-dark-fate-film-review-arnold-schwarzenegger-linda-hamilton/)

> These movies have always been Sarah Connor’s continuing story, but the past movies either tried to exist without her or, once, reboot her. But with Terminator: Dark Fate we finally have the third chapter to her story, which at its essence is the Terminator franchise. Though, yes, by nature the story does have to be a little convoluted after the events of T2 (and this time, it’s basically just a whole new evil entity), but Linda Hamilton is Terminator. And that’s why Terminator: Dark Fate is the best Terminator movie since T2.

comment,f4u1tv7,,"This franchise was not designed to be a long lasting franchise. There's a reason why Cameron never came back or cared about the Terminator rights for decades, because it's difficult to come up with a fresh premise that works in the frame of time travel set in place, where we already saw the past win against Skynet twice while it's heavily implied the future resistance defeats Skynet. Unless you take a leap of faith and go past Skynet's defeat or fight a new villain altogether, I just don't see how a new terminator movie would work that feels fresh and innovative.",Pancake_muncher,movies,339,,2019-10-23 02:16:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dlr883/terminator_dark_fate_review_thread/f4u1tv7/,False

comment,f4tqatv,,"Rise of the Machines couldn't hold a candle to the previous two installments, but it would still have been a decent enough conclusion to the cinematic universe.

Then The Sarah Connor Chronicles happened, which I both loved and hated for pulling me back in and leaving me hanging. Just needed one more season to wrap things up. Been trying to find closure ever since, but Salvation and Genisys broke my heart. 

It's tough to take all these reboot attempts seriously when you've already seen cool stories being told in this universe and know that you don't need to keep bringing Arnold back, you can make the future stuff and implications of time travel actually interesting, you can easily recast Sarah or John Connor, you can even have frikin' Brian Austin Green as a believable bad ass. Just write a damn solid script, which I realize is asking a lot in this day and age.

comment,f5zbd13,,"So I just finished watching the movie and here is my mostly spoiler free opinion: This is easily the third best film in the franchise and considering its against T1 and T2, that's not an insult. The film is not perfect and does not capture the same charm that T2 has nor is it as innovative or original as the first but it has more than enough strength to place it alongside them. New character Grace is a great addition and nice way to take the story in a new direction that other sequals failed at accomplishing. Dani starts out alot like Sarah Conner in T1, overwhelmed and making bad decisions, but quickly grows out of it. I admit I had to hold my suspension of disbelief at how quickly she grow into her role, but the the acress' performance allows me to look past that. Sarah Connor is a no fucks given woman who is way past the point of caring what others think about her and a great return to the role for Linda Carter. Good ol Arnold is here as the T800, though not the one from T2. He acts as more of a secindary role here, with Grace, Dani, and Sarah sharing the spotlight and that's not a bad thing. He doesn't steal the show by saving them, but instead helps tilt things in their favor. The Rev-9 is admittedly a weaker point in the movie since it's clear that he is essentially the T1000 all over again, but it's less that it doesn't work (the actor does an admirable job replicating the danger the T1000 evoked. and more that I was hoping for more than a 2 in 1 Terminator. Though I honestly don't know what they could have done better since it does make sense.

Overall the plot is well paced. Very quickly getting to the action and plot and it doesn't try to take an exposition dump to explain everything. The information is spread out through out the movie going you times to take a breather as to not be overwhelmed with it's action. There are some noticeably distracting moments in fight scenes where the CGI become very uncanny and rubbery but they a thankfully few and spread out so it doesn't ruin the scene. 

I can't get into much more without spoiling it, so I will say that it is a excellent attempt at revamping a franchise that has become very bad over the past decade. It definitely has parts that detracts from it, but none of the are enough to pull down the whole. If you are a fan of the franchise and want to see it treated with respect, this will satisfy you. And if you Justin want a quality action flick, then you will enjoy it as well.",DrKnives,movies,17,,2019-11-01 01:37:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dlr883/terminator_dark_fate_review_thread/f5zbd13/,False

comment,f4xp2i0,,"I liked this movie, quite a bit more than I thought I would. However the CGI is so superficial when compared the magic of the originals and their combination of practical effects and old school CGI. And my god Natalia Reyes is awful, it's like she's reading off a card the entire time, she has no charisma, no emotional range, nothing that would even make you think for a second she could turn scavengers into militias, and militias into an army. Every time she does anything it completely fails to land, it is a poor performance from an actor in an otherwise solid ensemble cast. I didn't mind Gabriel Luna's take on the feline Robert Patrick's t1000, Linda's war hardened soldier is as good as ever albeit a little more jovial at times and Arnie is Arnie (we will ignore his first introduction 15mins and pretend that sh*t didn't happen). Mackenzie Davis brings the right amount of humanity, humour and emotion to the role and I was fully prepared not to buy into her in all of this.

comment,f63et90,,"* spoilers *

As soon as Arnold was introduced as the killbot that turned soft and got into drapery and family, I  was tuned out. I literally blocked my ears when he was doing that exposition. It was a horrible sub-plot. 

In T2, Arnie kills himself to ensure that he doesn't endanger John in some way. And now here's this Terminator who thought he'd stick around for years and make friends. Complete nonsense. 

It became evident that he was just going to be a plot device to assist the sisters and stop the half-mystique half-venom terminator. And that he will do a kamikaze move in the end to make the sacrifice play. 

I agree with the majority sentiment here that the time loop plot is so overdone that its eliminated the 2 key ingredients that made T1 and T2 so good - nail-biting horror and unpredictability. 

A part of Hollywood recently seems to be recreating movies by aligning closely to a framework that has worked in the past. Its not about a lack of creativity but a mitigation of risk it seems. The theory is that hey people in the 90s loved that theme, however, newer generations haven't seen the original film. Why not pitch a modern version of the same gimmick, switch the protagonist genders to mix it up and see if it triggers the same emotions. 

Disney is trying to do something similar with all its live action remakes and seeing decent success. The plot of the new movies is essentially the same as before. The treatment is different. But the difference is that Disney pitches it as a remake, not as a progression or sequel. 

The problem is that newer audiences have matured to a point where they aren't impressed by a linear time travel plot anymore (unless done really well). And the generation of the 90s are sick and tired of the repetition. Results in an epic fail on both fronts. 

Someone suggested an interesting potential theme although I'd work on a better ending:

""Kick off the movie with John Connor sending Arnie back into time to protect his younger self.  Skynet eventually realizes time travel is proving to be a deadlock and moves away from that strategy. Instead, it adapts to outthinking humans in the present by attempting to break the resistance from the inside. 

The resistance is shown to do initially well before things start collapsing. It starts facing jeopardy with internal confusion and unexpected predicaments. 

Later it is learned that Skynet created ""mole"" terminators that pose as believable human recruits to join the humans with a dormant mission to first understand the factors that lead to their prophesized win. 

Then, they start meddling around to engineer an implosion. Throw in some scenes where they impersonate John and create confusion. 

Generate suspense till the end and show how John ""Mcgyvers"" his way around the new strategy to score a close win for the humans.""

Anyway, they need to change their game to keep the franchise alive and kicking.",chaoslyric,movies,10,,2019-11-02 06:28:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dlr883/terminator_dark_fate_review_thread/f63et90/,False

Spoilers.....



Since Cyberdyne was stopped and then John Connor is killed at the start of this all that really happens is that you never really can stop the future from happening because both were just easily replaced. Cyberdyne with Legion and John with Dani.

Just thought it was kind of pointless to do it like this. Just shows that even if Legion is stopped, Dani will eventually be killed anyway and both will all be replaced by another corporation and another person.

comment,f5jjlnm,,"I really looked forward to this. I so badly want them to do Terminator right. But sadly they really did hit a creative dead end. It’s such a wasted opportunity. To have friggin Linda Hamilton back and to do THIS? Gabriel Luna and Mackenzie Davis are phenomenal in their roles. This trinity saved it for me.

But man an older, female action badass character. I love this bit so much and I wish Hamilton would return for more! Maybe a movie wt her following those texts and destroying terminators. id much rather watch a trilogy of that.

Personally, to make it interesting id have Grace’s hands full by having to protect 2 people for the future - a pair of siblings. justifying getting help from Sarah Connor but the fact that Luna’s terminator is such a formidable foe they’d need Arnie’s help, warranting his presence.

1. Diego Boneta, Dani’s brother invents the time travel machine and have Sarah Connor have a motherly relationship wt him as he reminds her of John. Have him study arnie’s and grace’s modifications too. Perhaps he can do some underdog thing and alter Arnie slightly to be used as a an effective weapon against Luna. The alteration will destroy him but its cool cz he now has a purpose.

2. Natalia Reyes’ character be kept as the future leader of the new resistance (even tho i so want to be rid of this idea to keep fresh) and keep that comradery thing with Grace. She comes up with the idea of using Arnie’s terminator as a weapon against lunas. Portraying her as an effective strategist and leader.

So since Luna can do the separating thing, Grace can fight Luna and Arnie can battle the skeleton. Grace doesn’t have to die but Arnie does. 

I so badly hoped they’d run a way from the future lewder of the resistance plotline. Have the inventor be taken out instead. I mean the future changed bt yet one way to go about changing it doesn’t, so wouldn’t it make sense to be rid of  the time travel machine? The stakes gets even higher that way. No time travel no changing anything. im not the only fan who thought of this, i see it everywhere on reddit/twitter. Makes you wonder how did they not think of this?

Arnie’s return was a bonus. Seeing him and Linda onscreen together after so long felt so good but doesn’t mean i enjoyed what they did to him. i dont dig it. seems so contrived. Id keep arnie as a useless machine with no purpose that lives underground for so long and does nothing but send Sarah coordinates, until the group arrives to use him as a weapon against Luna.",TheJack0fDiamonds,movies,5,,2019-10-28 02:40:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dlr883/terminator_dark_fate_review_thread/f5jjlnm/,False

post,b8340z,"The Jean-Claude Van Damme vs. Michael Myers jet ski chase in ""Halloween VIIII - Battle on the Bayou: Michael's Final Halloween"" covered 180 miles and they circled a tiny island 848 times during the four hour chase",">*Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween* *is what happens when you sneeze into a cheap tissue.* [***Roger Ebert (1996)***](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-blue-sea-1999)

Many of you remember [***Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween***](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/)as the film that ended the run of the *Halloween* franchise. In 1996, the series was reeling after the poor performance of [***Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers***](https://youtu.be/-v8l6cCrf0w)*,* and it was given one last shot to stay relevant in the evolving horror market. Knowing that the series needed a change, the producers and executives at Dimension Films decided to send Michael Myers to Louisiana to hunt the brother he never knew he had. In a major casting coup, Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast as Police Detective Chance Strode, the long-lost older brother of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). JCVD’s career had hit a rough patch after *Street Fighter, Sudden Death,* [***Drop the Beat***](https://youtu.be/q6ObhNBURyY) and [***Spin-Kick City*** ](https://youtu.be/i31XFSORRfc)failed to hit at the box office, so, desperate for a minor rebrand, he signed on to play the role for a lesser-fee with money promised on the back end.

&#x200B;

The producers at Dimension couldn’t afford to pay an established director, so they brought in stuntman legend and first-time director Steve Balsawood (stunts for *Lawrence of Arabia, Ghost*, [***Fire 2: Too Hot To Handle***](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo), and [***Backslap: The Movie***](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw)*)* to direct a script written by a young writer named Chuck Finley, who had written the well-received and commercially successful 1995 horror film [***Don’t Throw That Knife At Me!***](https://youtu.be/HsRwyJw5o7k). If there was one concern, it was that the movie had to go from script-to-screen in a mere six months, which meant the filming would commence without a finished script and locations that were not fully scouted or vetted.

&#x200B;

[Some concept art from the movie](https://preview.redd.it/ivsbttm6xnp21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3e482a9b77988f55184189f470762aa02aaec03)

&#x200B;

Desperate to bring in additional funding to beef up the $4 million budget.  The folks at Dimension signed a partnership with Yamaha to feature their X45 jet skis for a sizable amount that would help pay for the 23-day shoot. All was good until JCVD told the producers that he wouldn’t partake in any night shoots, which forced Finley and director Balsawood to revamp the script to make it a “day-time horror picture.” After several sleepless nights, and many unforgivable insults flung at each other, the two nailed down a script that played like a *Halloween* movie met *Nowhere to Run* and *Hard Target,* then completely forgot the *Halloween* angle\*.\* The highlight of the script was a jet ski chase that featured JCVD chasing down Michael Myers to make sure he can’t obtain the Spear of Destiny, which would make him even more immortal.

&#x200B;

[I never thought I'd see Michael Myers wear a suit while riding a jet ski.](https://preview.redd.it/ia6y4rmgxnp21.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcab33c5750ee079eb57c4a7725ca210b3d59aaa)

&#x200B;

Shooting began soon thereafter and everything quickly became a nightmare due to unreliable jet ski prototypes, infighting, terrible weather, rewrites, adultery, rampant drug use, scurvy, bad shellfish, impromptu crying sessions and budget cuts which you can read about in Balsawood’s book [***I Hated Directing That Movie***](https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg)*.* The rest is history, but one scene has always stuck with me and I finally decided to tackle it in hopes of making sense of it.

&#x200B;

[JCVD and a friend ride around for seven minutes talking about how great the jet skis are. ](https://preview.redd.it/fwcr41rcxnp21.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1067e66719a5db4a2b10d39f0a3e1015dd260e85)

&#x200B;

The following breaks down the incredibly random jet ski chase during the climax of the movie. I read in Balsawood’s book that they only had one day to shoot the scene and no locations to film the actual chase. So, the director, JCVD and a masked stuntman went out to a tiny island on the last day of principal photography and shot several hours of footage near the island. During their shooting, JCVD and the stuntman were only able to drive around the island 12 times due to the unreliable Yamaha X45 prototypes. Thus, the climax of the movie is centered around[ **two men driving around in circles**](https://youtu.be/gfXns_cU8I8).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A nice graphic of the chase](https://preview.redd.it/l9u2l57axnp21.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da18cabd1081bf0e85edb8f7293f1142f4fd8f8)

**Here are my assumptions:**

* They averaged 45 MPH during the entire chase
* They covered 180 miles during the chase
* They circled the tiny Louisiana island an estimated 848 times.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I know:**

I know a lot because the movie tells us everything

1. The movie has a [**36% Tomatometer score**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090759_deep_blue_sea), and it made [**$37 million at the international box office.**](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deepbluesea.htm) Surprisingly, it has a [**7.6 rating on IMDb.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149261/)
2. The X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.  We learn this when JCVD says “Wow, the X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.”
3. The rectangular island has a diameter of 360×160 feet and the best way to circle it on the jet ski is to stay 20 feet away from the shore (380×180 feet = 1,120 foot diameter). We learn this when Crazy Cajun Karl (Clint Howard) says “look for an island that is roughly equal to the size of a American foosball\* field….including the endzone. Make sure to circle twenty feet around the shore.”
4. The chase scene lasted four hours. I know this because during the scene JCVD yells “It’s almost been four hours and these X45 Yamahas are still running. What efficiency!”
5. The only person who can grab the “Spear of Destiny” is the man who fulfills a very specific prophecy. We learn this when Crawdaddy Kat (Kathy Bates) says “Only the man whose Yamaha jet ski runs of gas may grab the spear of destiny. He only can be stopped by a man who has run out of gas while riding the same exact Yamaha jet ski.”
6. The gas tanks were totally full. We know this because when Michael Myers and JCVD steal them, the gas station attendant says “Hey! I just filled them X45 Yamahas with gas!”
7. I know they circled the island because of the movies theme song, which peaked at number #78 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Charts in 1996. The song [**“Going in Circles” by Lit**](https://youtu.be/aFZtFoMX-EU), featured these lyrics “We’re going in circles, circles never stop because their infinite, much like Michael Myers.”

There you have it! JCVD and Michael Myers circled a tiny Louisiana island 848 times during their four-hour chase scene in *Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween.*

I did not get a chance to see this one and am assuming Yamaha X45 prototypes cannot pivot 90 degrees so they would have to change directions through a curve. In that case, if that curve remains exactly 20' away from the shore then the traveled path is 1165.7' per lap. So, they may have done as few as 792 laps, if a 90 degree pivot was a feature of the X45 prototypes, or 815.3 if they maintained an exact 20' offset from the perfectly rectangular shoreline.

post,a2dx8f,Was movies ever held in contempt by older generations and traditionalists the way gaming is seen as childish and skateboarding seen as rebellious and delinquent?,"Movies have gotten so mainsteam that practically everyone from diehard Republicans to ISIS terrorist fanatics and humanist liberals to some random pretty chick in Indonesia living in a small village have their own personal favorite movie. Its a telling thing that even religious fundamentalist create their own movies and have films they adore and how libertarians, gamers, 10 year old kids, Vietnam War Vets, and even drug addicts see the values of using movies to promote their agendas and to have mental masturbation.

&#x200B;

However I am wondering if there was a time when movies was seen as not just as low-brow but ""corrupting the youth"" and even being bashed as the creation of Satan? I mean while gaming has gotten pretty mainstream there is still backlash among conservative parts of society. Even people who grew up as recent as the 80s are criticizing that young WELL-EDUCATED and SUCCESSFUL adults spend an hour or 2 a day gaming. I seen a traditionalist Catholic website bash gaming as idolatry and there was an article about Al Qaeda guys destroying video game consoles and game discs in Afghanistan years ago. Many sports that are now pretty popular such as MMA and Skateboarding get the hack for its brutality and for making youths more aggressive and criminal. Even stuff such as the internet get hacked by people who grew up in the 50s and 60s because its taking time away from old fashioned quality time with other people in persona nd more ""human"" methods of communicaiton such as phone calls and writing letters.

&#x200B;

Did movies ever get the hack in this manner? I'm not specifically talking about individual movie titles but the medium and hobby as a whole. I mean even complex games touching very tough subjects and being educational such as the Total War series get bashed for being childish simply because they are games. In much of academia few people still do thesis and other school assignments on comic books because comics has a stigma of being cartoony and absurdly cheesy despite very mature comic books coming out for the last decade such as The Sandman series.

&#x200B;

Was there ever such stuff such as intellectuals refusing to watch movies because of its lack of brainy artistic value or church pastors and ministers attacking movies as a creation by Satan? Or conservative parties doing acts of terrorism and bombing a movie theater and movie studios because they are so convinced of how evil and traitorous movies are much like how some fascists and nationalists had bombed stores selling condom in the past in Catholic countries?  Has movie faced a time when it was only for ""irresponsible hedonistic youths"" the way gaming and skateboarding faces the current stigma?",BooniedDog85,movies,0,13.0,2018-12-02 15:08:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/,True

comment,eay10f3,,"This isn’t an answer to your question, but a relevant suggestion:

Check out the podcast *You Must Remember This*. It’s an in-depth look at Hollywood throughout the 20th century and how film influenced society and culture. It’s a great podcast. I feel like I was sitting in on a really interesting history class all about film every time I listen to it.",None,movies,1,,2018-12-02 19:42:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eay10f3/,False
comment,eay9hfw,,"Visual language is a very debatable. The things these commenters have listed are some really insightful and rich pieces of information about what you’re looking for.

For me the thing I always return to when thinking about this sort of thing is the interview with John Cleese and Michael Palin regarding the release the The Life of Brian. Not just because the two heavily religious individuals who debate them in the interview do so through the perspective of devout Christians, but because they are clearly have generation on Cleese and Palin. 

You can see how much the visual language of a film that mocks the culture they were brought up in brings them to believe that the film will be received with worthless intent but also that it will influence the next generation with the wrong values. The idea that a film will destabilise the foundation of their belief in how society operates in hindsight shows how progression is something that those in a position of power fear a world that will live and breathe without them.",Skyfryer,movies,1,,2018-12-02 20:59:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eay9hfw/,False
comment,eayrk02,,"Oh, for SURE, and in some ways they still are! Theater actors in particular will go on about how screen acting isn’t REAL acting, and novelists tend to look down on screenwriters. I blame this for why so many filmmakers are pretentious as shit, they feel the need to continually prove that their craft is just as valid as any other art (even if they’re not that good at their craft).",None,movies,1,,2018-12-02 23:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eayrk02/,False
comment,eaxg59t,,"The responses on this are interesting, thanks everyone, and thanks OP for asking the question.

I think one aspect to consider is that at some point, films seemed to appear to ""grow up"" to the masses, while something like comics or video games really haven't (yet). Despite there being standout examples of good storytelling in both mediums, the majority of each honestly still consist of more childish and simplistic themes.

Film has had great directors to help the medium mature; Welles, Hitchcock, Kubrick, all contributors. Video games, especially, haven't had too many visionaries with an eye for maturing the medium. Many people cite the likes of Naughty Dog, or Bioware, however the ""maturity"" they add is done so via the cinematic elements, already established by film; the best compliment you can give those sorts of games is, ""they're almost like a movie,"" while the reverse is never true.

For a while through the 80s and 90s, video games seemed to be advancing as a medium at an exponential rate, but more in terms of mechanics and game design; they were getting closer to solidifying what the hell this medium is going to be. At some point, though, they became stagnant, and we're at the point now where it seems like the same games come out every year, none of which is really more mature, or really grows the medium.

Video games in particular, interactive media, is a fascinating new medium, and one with a lot of hidden potential. I'm not sure what the place is for video games in the future, but I'm hoping someone with a vision is able to take it and do something truly wonderful with it.",Bingo675,movies,0,,2018-12-02 16:20:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eaxg59t/,False
comment,eay0f8u,,"The difference for many is film is an art where as video games are more well games. Films you can watch in one evening where as video games are something you have to invest more time and energy into  it. Films are more about ideas, emotions and interpersons where as games are more about exercises, yes I know some games do other but that's often with the expense of game play for more cutscenes",Macanchait,movies,3,,2018-12-02 19:36:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eay0f8u/,False
comment,eay3txs,,"Sure, but that perception is really just based around how we experience reward when consuming them. Something considered ""art"" normally is more deeply rewarding to us than something more fleeting like the feeling of accomplishment from completing a tricky level in a game. So far, the rewards that games give us are more akin to mental junk food, especially when compared to something like a Kubrick film.",Bingo675,movies,1,,2018-12-02 20:09:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2dx8f/was_movies_ever_held_in_contempt_by_older/eay3txs/,False

post,9w3tbf,"The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Sequels Had So Much Potential","First and foremost, I'm only referring to installments 2 and 3. I have not seen 4 and 5, so I can't speak for them.

I currently have the 3rd installment, *At World's End*, on as I do homework. Clearly I'm not getting much homework done, but that's a story for another time. There are some moments that are very unique for a massive budgeted blockbuster distributed by Disney. The opening scene with several people getting hanged is very brave for a studio known for family films and Jack Sparrow's hallucination is deliciously bizarre. But for every unique scene, you get a long drag of political mumbo jumbo that takes a negative, and pointless, tole on the movie. Not to mention, the film feels the need to develop each and every side character, which is completely unneeded.

The same said for the 2nd installment, *Dead Man's Chest*. It is a fun sequel that expands the universe created in the first film, has some fun action beats, and ends with a cliffhanger that makes the third installment feel *needed* instead of *forced*. Not to mention the fantastic villain of the film, Davy Jones. He is the classic example of a new villain in a series that really amps up the suspense, and the CGI used to create him still looks great. But, much like the third, it has too much. Whether it's plot beats or characters, it is filled to the brim with nonsense.

The first is a classic blockbuster that introduced us to a wonderful world and one of Hollywood's best anti-heroes, Jack Sparrow. It may not be perfect, but it is a blast that could've been improved on with even better sequels. In my opinion, these films could've been a fun blockbuster trilogy, up there with the *Back to the Future* trilogy or the original *Indiana Jones* films, had they not caved in under their own hubris.",MovieBuff90,movies,146,116.0,2018-11-11 13:36:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w3tbf/the_pirates_of_the_caribbean_sequels_had_so_much/,True

comment,e9i2yr0,,"My big problem is that I just don't understand why the world of the first film needed to expand into a serialized format.

I was around 20 when the first one came out, and it's good to remember that the first *Pirates* came out in the wake of *Attack of the Clones* and the *Matrix* sequels. Which, at the time, felt weirdly self-serious and needlessly byzantine to me. They were stodgy. Characters spoke flatly. Internal world politics were suddenly very important. Everything was Serious Business. And then the first *Pirates* movie comes out, and it's one of the first films in a while (since at least *The Mummy*, four years prior) that felt like a fun, brisk, showy entertainment. It felt like classic adventure larks. The skeletons had a Harryhausen vibe, the swashbuckling felt like *Indiana Jones* and *The Adventures of Robin Hood*. The flick was fun and just wanted to give you a good time. No greater meaning. No interest in pursuing some sort of larger mythos or world. (It was also a lot of fun for how surprising it was, due to being based on a theme park ride.)

And then the sequels just build and build and build on top of it. Now Elizabeth's ex-husband matters. Now there are more issues of pirate/imperial tensions. Now we have villain on top of villain on top of villain. Now we have a witch, who, wait, now she's a goddess, no wait, now she's crabs, she's just all crabs. For lack of a better word, the story got big and *wide*, but it didn't get *deep*, and even then, who the hell wants either when the pleasure of the first one was that it *didn't give a shit*? The first film knows it's nonsense, but by the third film, we're watching a three hour slog where pirates have political conferences that might as well have been airlifted from the Zion set of *The Matrix Revolutions* or the Jedi Chamber of *The Phantom Menace*.

[Sidebar: It was around this time that I learned how truly terrible political conference rooms are in fantasy/adventures. It's like screenwriters don't know how to deliver exposition in a fascinating way, so they just sit everybody in a circle and force them to talk about the plot. UGH. It's one thing to have Doc Brown put on a demonstration, or even for Gibbs in these films to whisper to Jack in the back of a seedy bar - but then to have heads of pirate clans gather and just argue at each other?]

[Sidebar 2: okay, the Council of Elrond was a good data dump.]

In general, I wish the films were more like *Indiana Jones* in that each story was just a fun self-contained pirate adventure. Keep Jack Sparrow, sure (he's certainly more interesting than Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan), but give us a fleet, reliable entertainment every few years. (Go figure, *Mission Impossible* has fulfilled this role much better with its last three films.)

One more thing: Terry Rossio (co-writer of the *Pirates* movies) [wrote something on his blog 12 years ago](http://www.wordplayer.com/archives/rossio08.Nine.Pieces.html) that I've remembered ever since, quoted below:

>One reporter wants to know why the film is ""overly complex."" This allows me to climb my favorite soapbox and rant on the topic of complexity -- which I believe is an asset to any film. ""Audiences love complexity,"" I tell them. ""You wouldn't say a film is too funny or too dramatic, and so it's nonsense to say a film is too complex -- as long as it makes sense and is logical."" You would think that critics, who must suffer through many films that are boring because they are far too simple, would appreciate this point, but again they do not look convinced.

This was super-clarifying at the time, because I *fundamentally disagree* with him. I don't think complexity is intrinsically positive to a story, any more than simplicity is. It's all about how you use it. (He adds that caveat too about ""makes sense,"" but it's a bit limp.) And I really don't think the first film set up a world built for complexity. Its pleasures were retro and mercifully simple: charm, wit, fun visuals, action. But the movies end up so leaden and lurching by the end. Some great weird-ass visuals, but not much else.

**TL;DR** I didn't like how the films were serialized/expanded, wish it kept its B-movie nonsense sensibilities, stayed with individual adventures (like *Indiana Jones*), and disagree with the screenwriter on the inherent value of complexity.",deadandmessedup,movies,21,,2018-11-11 19:37:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w3tbf/the_pirates_of_the_caribbean_sequels_had_so_much/e9i2yr0/,False

comment,e9hcu8u,,"IMO, the problem that the Pirates follow-ups had was unique, in that it needed *more* films.

In a climate where stuff like The Hobbit and Harry Potter and Hunger Games are getting spread too thin and stretched into more movies than necessary in order to grab some cash, the Pirates franchise is one of the few franchises where that probably would have been better.

The first film is largely stand-alone, and fucking brilliant. But to keep the story going, and going well, they kick off an entire trilogy’s worth of material and story in the sequel. Davy Jones, Sparrow’s past, Calypso, Will and Elizabeth and the pirate court and all the side characters who we’ve come to love in some small way — these all require time.

Trying to kick it off and wrap it up in two movies meant a dark and impressive and ambitious outing with Dead Man’s Chest, but then a bloated finale that didn’t really satisfy any of the storylines. Jack’s arc comes closest, because they probably put the most care into it, but even Will and Elizabeth’s conclusion falls emotionally flatter than it should. 

But the moment between human Davy Jones and Calypso in jail? That should be emotional as hell, but we have to sail right by. The pirate court and all that should be epic as hell, but we sail right by. 

They should’ve left the first as a stand-alone adventure and announced a new trilogy with Dead Mans Chest.",None,movies,16,,2018-11-11 14:30:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w3tbf/the_pirates_of_the_caribbean_sequels_had_so_much/e9hcu8u/,False
comment,e9ihvpy,,"Jack Sparrow was a needed character in the first movie, not the protagonist. He filled as a character the plot in the moments where divine intervention was needed. In all other films he was the protagonist, without a story original or true to the character, thought that is what they tried to do. That ruined the character. Imagine movies like the first one, where all other get in trouble but Jack through some clever, imaginative and surprising  plot gets in to help, or to mess things up, but never to save the day.He is a pirate, not a hero.

So first movie we know what everyone was, what was doing and what he was after and the wild card was Jack. But then movies went from bad to worsh because characters, they thought, matter more than plot which is good if you talk about snow white but not for the pirates of the Caribbean.

The 3rd is the one where I lost interest. It had a big build up and could have been great, but instead it was just really underwhelming. There are some good stuff in it, but most of it felt slow and boring. Not nearly as much energy as in the first movies. And let's not forget the very disappointing battle. It was hyped up in the movie with two large fleets that would fight. I was expecting to see some major ship to ship battles with dozens of ships in the action. It would have been great.

They are visually interesting (something that can't be said for 4 and most of 5), the set design and epic scale is always fun to look at. All of the action, while convoluted at points, is motivated by character desires. Will wants to save his father, Jack wants freedom/to save his own skin, Elizabeth wants adventure, its all plot driven by character, which I think is more compelling than characters reacting to plot.

And THIS is the shit Will and Elizabeth have to defend because the East India Trading Company is terrible but dammit we need an ocean full of murderers and rapists like the good ol' days. Elizabeth giving this heartfelt inspiring message to the scum of the ocean just because EITC is the ""establishment"" is just embarrassing. It doesn't feel like an accomplishment to Will and Elizabeth because it feels like all the had to do was get the hell out of the toxic environment they were in and they would easily avoid all the drama of their relationship. 

Everything about Will's father showing up felt completely unnecessary. The first movie went over Will's destiny vs. Will's father being a pirate, and they bring allll of that crap back in spades just to rehash it in stereo. 

Jack's got his ship, now what. Oh, he kinda sucks as captain. Suddenly he wants immortality, okay. Felt like the movie had to give him something to do, rather than it being a natural outcome of his personality.

comment,e9ht1si,,"Because in the first movie he was written as a normal pirate in the screenplay. The quirky persona of Jack Sparrow was completely created and improvized by Depp who made the character his own. Apparently Disney didn’t even like what Depp was doing with the character and feared it would ruin the movie. Just look at the original trailer, and how they cut and portay him there. They pretty much leave him out of the trailer.

The rest is history ofcourse as it turned out this was a briliant turn from Depp and was what people surprisingly liked most about this film. In the sequels they pretty much wrote him as the ‘drunken fool who is funny’ instead of that smart pirate.

comment,e9jt5pu,,">  In the first he was a mad genius but hiding it behind the drunken fool persona.

I just want to challenge this idea because what I always saw was a character we were never sure if he was a mad genius or a lucky fool.  Rather his confidence and gravitas always hid the truth behind his character.

That, to me anyways, is what made him so compelling.  

That said, they definitely changed his character to be a drunken fool as the series went on, which ruined an otherwise great character.

#Notable Box Office Stories

* Aided (slightly) by a [$66.5 million opening weekend in China](https://twitter.com/weier1231997/status/972854217651109888), **Black Panther** surpassed $1 billion in worldwide box office on Saturday, joining [an elite club](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/) of less than 40 films (without adjusting for inflation) that have achieved this. [As /r/boxoffice pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/83g1qt/black_panther_is_now_officially_the_1st_mcu_movie/), it is the first MCU film that does not have an appearance by Tony Stark to reach $1 billion worldwide. The domestic gross of *Black Panther* is now [7th overall](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm) and exceeds that of *The Dark Knight* ($534,858,444), as well as the combined domestic gross of *Justice League* and *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* ($228,977,297 and $330,360,194, respectively). *Black Panther* came in second place behind *A Wrinkle In Time* on Friday ($9,972,000 vs $10,214,000, respectively) but regained the lead for the weekend, with a weekend domestic box office of $41,136,000. This was also *Black Panther*'s fourth consecutive weekend at #1, and while we still have a long way to go before we see something like [*Titanic*'s 15 consecutive weekends at #1](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/bestranked.htm?page=WKNDSCAT1&p=.htm) again, *Black Panther* could be the first film since 2009's *Avatar* to spend five consecutive weekends at #1 if it beats *Tomb Raider* (the only new major release) next weekend (more on that later).

* Currently sitting at 42% on Rotten Tomatoes, the mixed critical reception for **A Wrinkle In Time** may have contributed to its second place opening at the domestic box office this weekend, with $33,316,000. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/03/11/box-office-why-wrinkle-in-time-stumbled-with-33m-debut-weekend/#64abc55c258d) speculates that the ""unexpected post-debut strength"" of *Black Panther* and the lack of time between its release and that of AWIT's may have hindered AWIT's ability to take the top spot on its opening weekend. The similarities between AWIT's opening weekend and that of two other famous Disney fantasy/sci-fi underperformers from recent history are hard to ignore; *John Carter* opened to $30,180,188 on the same weekend as AWIT in 2012, while *Tomorrowland* opened to $33,028,165 on the Memorial Day long weekend in 2015. Both of those films grossed less than $300 million worldwide, and both had budgets in the $200-250 million range. ^(I had previously listed the budget of AWIT as in the same range but redditors have rightly pointed out that that is only the case when you include prints and advertising; AWIT's production budget was $100 million, significantly less than that of the other two films mentioned.) [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2018/03/a-wrinkle-in-time-black-panther-weekend-box-office-1202324260/) points out that the most encouraging prospect for AWIT's next two weeks is the fact that K-12 schools will be on spring break over part/all of the next two weeks.

* With a domestic box office of $3,150,000, **The Hurricane Heist** did not manage to blow anyone away (heh) with its opening weekend performance. Its title immediately draws obvious parallels to last year's *Geostorm*, which opened to $13,707,376 in November of last year and ended up grossing $221,400,160 worldwide, even before the questionable quality of both films is taken into account (although it's worth noting *The Hurricane Heist* has more than double the RT percentage of *Geostorm* - 29% vs 13%!). It seems Hollywood is going to keep churning out disaster movies in the hopes of stumbling across another *San Andreas*, which opened to $54,588,173 in late May 2015 (this was one weekend after *Tomorrowland* opened - see my second bullet point). As for those of you who love bad movies and are lamenting the fact *The Hurricane Heist* will probably leave cinemas soon - fear not, for [*God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Not_Dead:_A_Light_in_Darkness) will be released on March 30!!

* After taking home Best Picture and Best Director last Sunday at the Academy Awards, **The Shape of Water** grossed $2,407,000 this weekend at the domestic box office, an increase of 62.8% from last weekend's gross of $1,478,754. An additional 720 cinemas in North America chose to play the film, no doubt a result of its success at the Oscars. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Chile's **A Fantastic Woman**, also opened in an additional 77 North American cinemas this weekend and grossed $287,277, an increase of 130% from last weekend's gross of $125,005. Despite taking home two of the acting awards, **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri** actually played in 218 *fewer* cinemas this weekend compared to last weekend, and saw a corresponding 45.2% drop in box office to $705,000 (compared to $1,287,401). Finally, not an Oscar film, but Armando Iannucci's **The Death of Stalin** opened in the United States this weekend - but only in four cinemas nationwide. Nonetheless, the outcomes of the Five-Year Plan were exceeded because each cinema grossed an average of $45,327! Let us hope the glorious Presidium bestows their comedic genius upon the entire nation soon!

* Most of the planet won't be able to watch the film until next weekend, but the reboot of **Tomb Raider** starring Alicia Vikander opened to $14.1 million this weekend in select Asian markets -
 including South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the Philippines. Notably absent from this list is China which is getting the movie next weekend as well. In June 2001, the first *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* opened to $47,735,743, while its 2003 sequel *Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life* opened to less than half of that with $21,783,641. Barring a very unlikely second weekend increase in box office for *A Wrinkle In Time*, *Tomb Raider* is the largest obstacle standing in the way of a fifth consecutive weekend at #1 for *Black Panther*, so I'm sure many of us will be paying attention to how well the film does next weekend domestically.

#Films Reddit Wants to Follow

This is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren't in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on. This week we have added *Annihilation* to the list at the request of /u/numb3red and /u/tahubob .

If you'd like me to add a film to this chart, make a comment in this thread.

Title |Domestic Gross (Cume) |Worldwide Gross (Cume) |Budget |Week # 
:--|:--| :--| :--|:--|
Thor: Ragnarok | $315,034,103 | $853,865,561 | $180M | 19
Coco	| $208,831,333 | $745,259,970 | $175M | 16
Star Wars: The Last Jedi | $619,463,731 | $1,331,429,897 | $200M | 13
The Greatest Showman | $167,475,401 | $388,578,795 | $84M | 12
Annihilation | $26,094,514 | info not available | $40M | 3

After twelve weeks, **The Greatest Showman** finally fell out of the domestic box office Top 10 this weekend, grossing $1,775,000 and landing at #13. On the [list of films that never made it to #1 in the domestic box office](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/never1.htm), it is in the top 20. Mainly I just wanted to link to this list so we can all be reminded again that one of the greatest Bond movies of all time (if not *the* greatest) never reached #1 because George Miller made a movie about dancing penguins.

comment,dvkom6t,,"The early reviews for Tomb Raider aren't that encouraging unfortunately. With a late embargo review that will probably benefit it's opening weekend but if Black Panther is holding on this well then I doubt it'll be topped by Tomb Raider which doesn't really seem to have much hype behind it.

That's all Tomb Raider needed to be was a personal movie about Lara learning to let go of her father's death with a tomb raiding mystery that ties into her character arc. That's similar to what Uncharted 4 did, with Nathan Drake's struggle to move on from his life tying with the pirate mystery of the game. Instead it looks like we're getting generic end of the world stuff. At the very least i'm hoping it's enjoyable like Assassin's Creed was for me. 

It sucks that all these video game movies keep failing for one reason or another. With Assassin's Creed the studio invested in a fantastic director/cinematographer, fantastic cast but for whatever fucking reason got some shit writers. Fucking why. If you're going to invest in a good director and cast then at least make sure the script is something good for fuck sake. Warcraft apparently got butchered by the studio with a lot of footage taken out and Tomb Raider is just falling in the generic blockbuster narrative traps. I just don't understand why this keeps happening.

I'm confident that the genre will get better and video game movies will end up being incredibly profitable and successful movie opportunities, but that will only happen with passion for the source material and knowing what works. For example with Assassin's Creed, the modern storyline is criticised by gamers so fucking keep it in the past. Just adapt Ezio's story or something. If they want a modern day storyline then show it for 5 minutes at the start of every act with some important character moments that can then be built upon in sequels. With Tomb Raider just keep it a personal character story with a tomb raiding mystery that compliments the character arc etc. There's ways these movies can be successful and we'll get there soon. I'm hoping that the upcoming Metal Gear Solid movie will be able to break the mould because the director is passionate about the franchise, but I can already see it getting butchered by the studio instead of having faith with the vision of the director (I mean obviously his vision could still have issues, but studio involvement doesn't lead to good results with these movies).",TheJoshider10,movies,737,,2018-03-12 13:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/83urrl/box_office_week_black_panther_is_1_for_the_4th/dvkom6t/,False

comment,dvkno6p,,"Black Panther continues to impress. That China opening is a superb result even though WoM isn't great it's still doing good considering some were worried it would flop of there. Overseas it's doing better than every other MCU film except the team up films and Iron Man 3. While I think most people were expecting a domestic breakout (though of course not to this extent)  the Overseas performance has also been beyond what most people thought.

Black Panther is gunning for The Avenger's domestic. And I don't mean it's normal total but its adjusted one. If you look at the highest grossing comic book films in NA **adjusting for inflation** you get films like Spider-Man 1, The Dark Knight and The Avengers. All of those films captured the general audience in a way few other films have  and are what people consider some of the best the genre has to offer for blockbuster entertainment. Black Panther belongs in that group now.

Sucks for A Wrinkle in Time and its another reason why Disney continues to move towards remakes for their live action division. But at least the budget was reasonable so any losses made won't be that large.

I thought the CGI was over the top and not very clean. I thought Black Panthers fight was way better and smooth in Civil War. And i thought some of MBJ lines were cheesy. and overall story was okay.

Again I liked it but not as much as other marvel movies.

comment,dvlmoge,,"AWIT is not anywhere near the same league as Black Panther in terms of quality, in my opinion. It feels like a clip show from a much longer adaptation of the story. Or like someone read the book, bookmarked the scenes they thought would look pretty on a movie screen, and then just shot those scenes and called it a day.

They included all the main characters from the book but chopped out enough narrative that one of the three protagonists (Calvin) no longer serves any purpose whatsoever in the story. Like literally, they could have just left him out and it would have had zero effect on the movie's plot.

And it's not even a matter of not having enough time to make it coherent. The start of the story, before they go on the adventure, drags horribly and feels about twice as long as it needs to be.

comment,drz63tq,,"Cop Land (1998)

I saw this film recently and it's a near miss as a whole... But the performances are incredibly nuanced and some of the best from the respective actors. It's Stallones best by a long shot.

You watch it and feel it needed an edit and probably a heavy weight script doc to come in and hone it a touch... But with an ensemble piece filled with everyone from Stallone, DeNiro, Keitel, Laotta (sp), Patrick, etc... everything is very underplayed to it's advantage. 

Definately a 'could have been' one of the greats but still pretty outstanding at times. And again, see it for Stallones low-key performance.

What other slightly more obscure but incredible foriegn films should I see?,"It doesnt just have to be horror/thriller though that is one of my favorite Genres. However it upsets me that such an absolutely incredible film sliped under my radar and it seems the radar of a lot of people in the US. What movies must I see that I likely havent heard of that are similar masterpieces. Movies from Korea? India? Japan? South America perhapse? A great example is “The Raid” which was made in indonesia and is now my favorite action movie of all time.

comment,dqy1tg9,,"Here are some Korean flicks recommendations. **Bold** ones are must-watch:

**Memories of Murder (2003)** - Directed by Bong Joon-Ho. Korean equivalent of Zodiac. Hailed as one of the greatest Korean films ever made.

**The Host (2006)** - Directed by the same guy who made Memories of Murder. Little Miss Sunshine meets Jaws.

**Mother (2009)** - A Bong Joon-Ho film. A mentally deficient son gets falsely accused for murder, his mother goes out to find the true criminal.

**The Chaser (2008)**  - Director of The Wailing. Inspired by the true event, a pimp chases after the serial killer.

Yellow Sea (2010) - Same director of The Wailing. There are two versions of this and Director's Cut is considered superior.

**Oldboy (2003)** - Do I need to explain how great this film is?

Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and **Lady Vengeance (2006)** - Oldboy director's other revenge flicks. Parts of his vengeance trilogy.

**The Handmaiden (2016)** - Director of Oldboy. Korean adaptation of Fingersmith. Modern masterpiece. 

**The Man from Nowhere (2010)** - Leon the Professional + Taken + The Man On Fire. John Wick was inspired by this movie.

Blood Rain (2005) - Set in 19th century, a detective finding out who is behind the serial murders. Korean version of Agatha Christie would be accurate.

**I Saw the Devil (2010)** - Ultra violent revenge movie that deconstructs the genre. Disturbing as fuck.

**A Tale of Two Sisters (2003)** - Finest Korean horror. Silent Hill 2 + The Ring. Director of I Saw the Devil.

**The Good, The Bad, The Weird (2008)** - Director of I Saw the Devil. Loose remake of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The most expensive SK film at the time.

Aachi & Ssipak (2006) - Team America + Redline. Don't watch the botched version that is uploaded on Youtube in an episodic order.

**Save the Green Planet! (2003)** -  I don't know how to describe it. It's a black comedy, I guess. Think of Dr. Strangelove meets Hostel. I know it sounds weird but because it is.

War of the Arrows (2011) - Loose remake of Apocalypto, set in 17th century about the war between Korea and Qing China.

R-Point (2004) - A military horror set in Vietnam War. Apocalypse Now + David Lynch. Amazing atmosphere, disappointing ending.

**Bedevilled (2010)** - Get Out + Django Unchained, except a lot more brutal. Most pure cathartic Korean revenge film you can see.

Train to Busan (2016) - World War Z meets Snowpiercer. Generic but incredibly fast paced entertaining zombie flick. Probably the most popular Korean film for now.

**Joint Security Area (2000)** - Director of Oldboy. A murder mystery set in the border between NK and SK. One of Tarantino's favorite films between 1992 and 2009.

The Isle (2000) - It's not gory, but it's psychologically creepy and extremely disturbing film that makes you cringe. 

Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (2003) - Director of The Isle. Hailed as one of the best Korean films ever made.

Han Gong-Ju (2013) - Based on the true story about depression, assault and rape. It does for a rape victim like what 12 Years a Slave did for slavery.

**Peppermint Candy (1999)** - Forrest Gump + Memento

**Poetry (2010)** - Same director of Peppermint Candy. Mother + Han Gong-Ju. Depressing.

Secret Sunshine (2007) - Director of Peppermint Candy. This film really hates religion.

Welcome to Dongmakgol (2004) - It's like a live action Hayao Miyazaki movie. Pacifist movie set in the Korean War.

**A Taxi Driver (2016)** - Based on the true story. Bloody Sunday + Rain Man.

**The Crucible, aka Silenced (2011)** - Korean equivalent of Spotlight. Need a shower after watching it.

**Taegukgi (2004)** - Korean equivalent of Saving Private Ryan. A little bit melodramatic.

Silmido (2003) - Korean equivalent of Dirty Dozen, except it actually happened. This might be the ridiculously manliest film ever made. Period.

The Thieves (2012) - Korean equivalent of Ocean's Eleven.

Assassination (2015) - Same director of The Thieves. Inglorious Basterds + Valkyrie

For old ones:

**The Housemaid (1960)** - Considered as Citizen Kane of the Korean cinema. The first Korean ""mindfuck' movie.  Bong Joon-Ho and Park Chan-Wook are big fans of film, and even Martin Scorsese led the HD restoration project.

The Marines who Never Returned (1963) - One of a very few old Korean war films that's not ""propaganda"". Fun trivia: all of gunshots the actors fired were actual real bullets because it was cheaper to buy real ones than blankets at that time. It's a public domain now so watch it here with sub https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rrBUUWRlwc

The Red Scarf (1964) - Korean equivalent of Top Gun, except came out earlier. Watch it here with sub https://youtu.be/7e4g10WcGcs

Woman of Fire (1971) - Remake of The Housemaid by the same director. It's kind of same, but different. He later remakes it again in 1982.

Abengo Airborne Corps (1982) - The first Korean war film that satirized other war films made at the time, mocking propagandist war movie cliches.

White Badge (1992) - Korean equivalent of The Deer Hunter.

**Sopyonje (1993)** - A family of traditional singers trying to make a living in changing 60s Korea. Masterpiece.

A Petal (1996) - Warning: You will have crippling depression if you watch it.

Green Fish (1998) - Director of Poetry. Neo-noir that shows the brutal world of Korean gangsters.

**Shiri (1999)** - The very first Korean blockbuster. It's quite dated now, but it literally revolutionized the Korean cinema. Before this film, most Korean films were drama and low-budget B films for the domestic market. If there was no Shiri, then there are no Oldboy, The Man from Nowhere, Train to Busan. Very similar to The Rock and Die Hard 3.",onex7805,movies,76,,2017-12-08 10:23:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7idf4q/i_just_finished_watching_the_wailing_on/dqy1tg9/,False

My favorite by Bong Joon-ho is definitely Mother. Super interesting, a little eerie. He also worked on Memories of Murder, which is super fun and pretty dark.
For Park Chan Wook its always gotta be The Handmaiden or Oldboy, if you haven't seen either of those already.
Sweet Bean is also a very good Japanese film. 
Let The Right One In--- I'm pretty sure everyone's seen this, but it's Swedish I think? And also very good.

comment,dqzklhn,,"I lived in Australia for many years (originally from the U.S.) and discovered quite a few amazing Aussie films that very few of my friends/family in the states have ever heard of. Here goes:

[Mystery Road](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_road_2013)  
A murder mystery set in the Australian outback. The cinematography is stunning and really captures the desolation of the Australian desert. The writing and acting are quite good as well.    


[Red Hill](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_hill_2010)  
This is a modern day western film set in a small rural town. Ryan Kwanten (played Jason Stackhouse in True Blood) plays the local police officer on the hunt for an escaped convict/murderer. It doesn't deviate much from the formula for your typical western, but as far as westerns go, it's pretty damn good.  


[The Loved Ones](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_loved_ones_2012)  
One of my favorite horror films of all time. The best way to describe it is a cross between Pretty in Pink and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And yes, it is truly as fucked up and wickedly good as it sounds.  


[The Babadook](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_babadook)  
Another great Aussie horror film. This one got released on Netflix in the U.S. a few months back and may still be there. It scared the shit out of me.  


[Chopper](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chopper)  
It doesn't get more Australian than this. A biopic about a man who was likely the most notorious Australian convict in the nation's history. Chopper was a truly fucked up individual who made money by torturing and stealing from mobsters in Melbourne. To some he was kind of a Robin Hood figure, except he spent his money on drugs and prostitutes instead of giving it to the poor. They made this film about him starring a young Eric Bana, which is truly amazing and one of the funniest Australian films I've ever seen. [Here's a clip](https://youtu.be/fHIOaP3Vga0) of the real life Chopper being interviewed by an Aussie news reporter so you can see how charismatic, charming and FUCKING crazy he was in real life.  


[Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_(1985_film\))  
This one will probably be hard to find. I actually discovered this way back in the 80's when I was a kid and HBO bought the rights to air it in the states. It was a made for TV movie about a school teacher and her class in a remote Australian town that get kidnapped and held for ransom. It's one of my favorite revenge films of all time and has one of the most genuinely messed up twists at the end.


[Wake in Fright](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wake_in_fright)  
I've not seen this film, but when I lived in Australia there was a big to do about them re-releasing a restored version of it. I've heard many critics refer to it as the best Australian film of all time.

comment,dqyl86f,,"**The Mimic**. Another South Korean horror movie that came out not long ago. I had to look away at the screen a number of times. There's not many good trailers for it. Has one of the best intros to a horror movie I've seen in a while. Basic plot: Family move into the countryside. They are struggling due to their son being missing and taking care of the grandmother with dementia. Nearby someone has opened up a sealed cave which is home to an evil spirit that lures its victim in by mimicking the recently dead. Then one day the family find a lost girl by the cave who starts to live with them. 

If you like action films or edge of your seat thrillers. **A Hard Day** (corrupt cop gets blackmailed after a hit and run and it spirals out of control) and **The Tunnel** (man gets stuck in tunnel collapse and when rescuers lose contact the government argues if they should allow a nearby mine to dynamite again as it's costing the country money when they assume he's a lost cause) are two great movies by the same director. 

Also for more women focused movies there is **Actresses** (fly on the wall mockumentary almost I think a improv movie about a group of actresses from different generations of Korean cinema getting ready for a photo-shoot. Great bitchy comedy which reflects the lives the actresses have in real life). Also **Sunny**, group of women reunite after one of their old gang is diagnosed with cancer. They go over memories of how their friendship was formed and fell apart. Some great comedy fights scene during a student protest. 

Political drama about North and South Korea soldiers is **JSA** by park chan wook. Really good and relevant 

More historical drama is **Taxi Driver**, based on a true story of a taxi driver who drove a German journalist into Gwangju when the protests against military dictatorship took place.

I [read a review in Variety](http://variety.com/2016/film/asia/creepy-review-kiyoshi-kurosawa-1201715993/) a few years back and finally got around to watching it this year. If you liked the Wailing you'll really enjoy this one. I strongly recommend you seek it out and watch it.

If you've watched Raid 1 of course watch Raid 2.

I skimmed through the replies and I'll echo the ones I think are in line with Wailing:

Under the Shadow (Iran). Creepy & atmospheric Iranian horror movie, if you're a horror fan you'll dig it but I'm not huge on horror so it definitely was a lot of handle horror-wise. 

Bong Joon-Ho is one of my Top 5 currently working directors. The Host = Cloverfield with less style but more substance. Snowpiercer I found to be a fun summer flick. Ojka is basically 2017's E.T. None of those are really similar to Wailing but Joon-Ho's great.

The Handmaiden. You think you've figured it out. Then you realized you had it all wrong.

REC & REC2. Scariest horror movies I've ever watched (granted that's a low bar). Found footage Spanish movie about a news reporter doing a feature tagging along with a fire department during their overnight shift when they get called to an apartment building with a disturbance that gets out of hand.

Raw. French movie that allegedly made people pass out while watching. There's nothing too bad/gruesome in it and it plays more like a coming of age movie than a cannibal horror movie. I mean, it's French.

In terms of action, I found the recent movie The Villainess pretty decent.

Finally, not foreign but I highly, highly recommend the movie The Invitation (on Netflix), it's similar to The Wailing in you have no idea what's going on for the first half of the movie and you just feel like something's *off* then boom shit hits the fan",ItsBobDoleYo,movies,0,,2017-12-09 02:47:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7idf4q/i_just_finished_watching_the_wailing_on/dqzc7rf/,False

comment,dpdekq1,,"Good list. *To Live and Die in L.A.* is in my Top 20 movies of all time. I love *20th Century Women* and *The Driver* but haven't seen much else. Although I intend to watch *Sorcerer* soon given that there's a new Blu-Ray release coming out on Monday in the UK.

I'd also throw in:

* *Times Square* (1980), a great 1980 punk film about gentrification in New York with an awesome soundtrack.

* *Escape to Victory* (Or, *Victory* as it's known in the US) (1981), which is reasonably well known in the UK but has little attention elsewhere and I've hardly seen it mentioned from anyone in US, about a group of POWs who have to play football against the German National Team during WW2 and Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, Max Von Sydow star alongside footballers Pele, Bobby Moore and few others. Directed by the great John Huston.

* *The Bad Batch* (2016) which is a criminally underrated second film from Ana Lily Amirpour (also watch her first movie) and features a terrific soundtrack and a great, stylish storyline.

* *The Girl With All The Gifts* (2016), based off an excellent novel by MR Carey (Mike Carey), it offers a fascinatingly unique take on zombies with a great cast. And it's really faithful to the book.

* *Clouds of Sils Maria* (2014), Olivier Assayas and Kristen Stewart make for an excellent combination and  really dug this movie which feels like a modern version of Fassbinder's *The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant*. Really great performances and Juliette Binoche is superb.

* *Another Earth* (2011), Brit Marling's performance is fantastic in this light-sci-fi movie about well, Another Earth. Putting the emphasis on character over story its cinematography is absolutely amazing and I can't recommend it enough.

* *In The Mouth of Madness* (1994). A really underrated masterpiece by John Carpenter that is the best Stephen King movie not based on a Stephen King adaption. It's a true delight and it's absolutely criminal it's not regarded up there with Carpenter's best.

* *Eating Raoul* (1982). A really entertaining and dark comedy/horror movie that sees a boring Los Angeles couple discover a bizarre/murderous way to get their funding for a new restaurant. It's something that I enjoyed a lot and I'd recommend it to any horror fans for sure.",Milo_BOK,movies,17,,2017-11-05 09:49:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7avgiw/123_lesserknown_movies_from_19762016_that_are/dpdekq1/,False

comment,dh50wbq,,"Bringing this thread back from the dead and I'm just assuming no one will ever read this. I just watched this and I'm stunned and puzzled by the beating it took with critics. It definitely reminds you of Wolf (a masterpiece), and Blow but still different enough to remain interesting. I see many comments on the film being lifeless, boring and it blows my mind. 

I was enthralled from beginning to end, McConaughey is one of my favorite actors and imo this is hands down one of his best performances. He is an absolute beast. He's had 2 losers lately with Free State Of Jones & this, but this one is weird. It felt exciting, fun, and Wells' determination and dream (actually one of the finer points in terms of characterization) elevated the film. Ramirez, whom I'm usually not a fan of, is excellent, so is the rest of the cast.

I did not see the twist coming, and I don't know, it just all came together for me, the whole structure of the film is very well handled by Gaghan, with some very fine direction. Elswit's cinematography alternating between digital & film is smart and appropriate, excellent work. Pemberton's score is quite good too. 

The ending threw me for a loop and had me wondering whether Wells was in it and had been performing a role, or whether Acosta is just holding his end of the deal.

comment,dd1bbip,,"I feel like I'm in the minority in that I actually enjoyed the film.  I'll break it up into thirds:

I really enjoyed the first third.  Great setup, great character introduction and building, pretty neat shots, great setup to the lifestyle of these guys.

Second third is where I feel the film lost its great potential.  Think it tried to focus on too many impacting things (relationship with Kay, Wall Street guys taking advantage of him, trying to show he was the biggest thing in mining in x amount of time).  I also feel like since Acosta was the focus of the spin, they lost focus on him a bit too much.

Final third was good, but not great.  I saw the spin coming and I feel like it could have ended at 4 different times.

In all, I believe if it would have focused on a dynamic between Acosta wanting to cash out and Wells wanting to keep building this dream, it would have been a bit stronger film.  The duo not seeing eye to eye, but fighting against the private equity together at the same time.

It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it's 38 RT bad.  Solid 6-7/10 film.  FWIW, I think the negativity is that people wanted more from it.",MrJACCthree,movies,18,,2017-01-28 23:54:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ql8p2/official_discussion_gold_2017_spoilers/dd1bbip/,False

post,5nxxsx,I feel like I've already seen the young Han Solo movie.,"I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling 'prequel-fatigue' but I think all of these ""the story behind [famous movie character/event]"" kind of movies are getting really predictable. Some recent examples include Victor Frankenstein, Oz the Great and Powerful, Star Trek (2009), Pan, Dracula Untold, The Hobbit and even Rogue One. At this point, I feel like I've already seen the young Han Solo movie because it will basically just connect the dots of events we already know about. My predictions:

Han Solo is a down-on-his-luck space orphan who is taken in by Woody Harrelson and taught the ways of being a smuggler and all around scoundrel. Somebody mentions the Force and Woody is like ""don't you go believing that mumbo jumbo, kid."" Cut to a few years later, a young adult Han wakes up in some girl's bed and leaves in a rush, being late for a job. Well, the job goes bad and Woody Harrelson dies. With his final words, he gives Han his blaster and ""lucky vest."" 

Han takes over the smuggling business and eventually finds himself in a card game that includes young Lando, who is forced to bet his ship to stay in the game. Han wins by bluffing and Lando takes him outside to show him his new ship... the Millenium Falcon. Lando is like, ""She takes two to fly properly."" And Han says something like, ""Looks like I'll need to find a co-pilot. You interested?"" Lando joins Han as a temporary co-pilot. ""Just one more job."" ""It's always just one more job.""

Despite hating the Empire, they need the work and upon delivering some Imperial supplies they see a bunch of wookies being taken captive. They rescue them and Chewbacca pledges a life debt to Han and joins the crew of the Millennium Falcon. Avoiding the Empire as they are now wanted men, they start taking more and more smuggling jobs, including dropping off a crate of supplies on Dagobah and Han saying ""who would want to live in a place like this?"" They fly by Bespin and Lando is like ""Sure would be nice to run a place like that one day."" And Han is like ""Yeah, keep dreaming, pal."" They swing by Alderaan so we can see Jimmy Smits with Artoo and Threepio and mention a delivery ""for some princess."" Bascially a parade of obligatory cameos from recognizable characters. Maybe we can cram Darth Vader in there again somewhere, or catch a glimpse of Forest Whitaker.

Eventually, Han takes a job for notorious gangster Jabba the Hutt. Lando is like, ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" Han gets cocky and careless and is discovered by the Empire. Ditches the cargo which belonged to Jabba. Now there's a price on his head. Lando quits the business. ""Take care of yourself, Han."" Reference to not wanting to be thrown in a Sarlacc pit. Chewbacca honors his life debt and becomes Han's co-pilot.

Jabba hires the deadliest bounty hunt in the galaxy to capture Han...Boba Fett. In an action-chase sequence, Fett almost gets him but at the last minute Han is saved by Chewbacca. Then Han is like ""Okay, pal, looks like we're even. I don't blame you if you want to take off."" And Chewie is like ""RRRAAAAUUUGHHH"" and Han is like ""Okay but how are we going to pay off Jabba?"" and Chewie roars again and Han says, ""A race? What kind of race?""

They enter into some races to make some extra money. Avoiding detection from the Empire AND bounty hunters is no easy task but with the Millenium Falcon, against all odds, they make the Kessel Run in less than 12 Parsecs. They win the money to pay off Jabba so they head back to Tatooine. Before they go to Jabba's palace, they stop by Mos Eisley for a drink. Chewie says some old man will pay handsomely for a ride to Alderaan...

**TL;DR These prequel stories are relying too much on references, nostalgia, and obvious fan pandering to make up for the lack of any engaging characters or story.**

[Rogue One Spoilers Below]

These nods to other films in the universe are called Easter Eggs because they are little bonuses that should be hard to find. Having the ""you'll be dead"" guys walking by in the background would be a cool Easter Egg. Having our main characters literally bump into them, then turn and give them their own close-up is just blatant and jarring, then they walk away and we never see them again. I didn't like the weird Truth Squid but at least it was something new and different.

Cut the Fandering^TM! Especially if it's utterly pointless. NO need to have an obligatory shot of Artoo and Threepio shoe-horned in. We didn't need to see Tarkin and Leia as CGI cartoons. (Why not just have CGI young Harrison Ford while we're at it?) Vader could have been an effective villain for Rogue One but instead he had no interaction with the main characters and zero affect on the story. If anything, he should have been the one to slaughter our heroes at the end but we can't have that in a movie where people cheer for Vader AND we're supposed to root for the rebels. So he kills a bunch of random guys of no consequence in a tacked on scene once the movie has essentially ended.

Prequels are fine if it's actually a story worth telling but not everything needs an elaborate origin story. We know the rebels got the Death Star plans so what was the story worth telling in Rogue One? We know Anakin becomes Vader so what was the story worth telling in the prequels? Now we know Han gets the Falcon from Lando and becomes a smuggler with Chewie so what's the story worth telling here? I don't know yet but I hope it's a good one.

comment,dcfb7dz,,"I am also sick of these movies but that goes double so for Han Solo just because of who this character is. I don't really care about his backstory; he's just a one scoundrel among millions in Star Wars. He was not noteworthy until he got wrapped up in Luke and Ben's shenanigans in ANH. 

That's not to say that he isn't an entertaining or charismatic character. I guess what I'm ultimately concerned about is that they're going to thrust him into a heroic journey that really doesn't fit a character who is a well known piece of garbage. I would feel fine about a 30M dollar heist movie with a young Han at the lead, or some other moderate budget genre flick. Since this is Disney, and it will be their second shot at the side story thing, what we're most likely going to get is a 150 million dollar blowout with at least 4 big action sequences, approx two emotional moments, and 50 quips. 

I just don't care to see that, and I don't think it fits Han as a character. ",JetJaguar124,movies,11,,2017-01-14 18:48:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5nxxsx/i_feel_like_ive_already_seen_the_young_han_solo/dcfb7dz/,False

comment,dcfo8qz,,"Just because something is a prequel doesn't mean the story is going to be predictable (other than the ending of course). There were many aspects of even the prequel trilogy (for better or worse) that were not predictable. And the events of Rogue One were completely unpredictable for me other than obviously getting the plans. The events that transpired around that, and the fact that [the main characters all die](#spoiler) was refreshing to me and something I didn't them expect to commit to.

Also I have a feeling, based on the track record of what we've got from this new Star Wars under Kathleen Kennedy, that it absolutely will NOT be a greatest hits movie of Han's rumoured adventures that we already know about. Perhaps there will be one or two references to those, or maybe one is featured prominently (if I was to bet, probably the Lando part), but I'm quite confident they will tell a largely completely new tale that is spaced in between or before all these events we've heard about.

comment,dcf8w6j,,"Here's how it went in the expanded universe which was shat on repeatedly by George Lucas during the prequel years.

Han was always an orphan that got taken in by a group of smugglers, run by a guy named Garris Shrike. There were other orphans in the ship too. Han's parental figure was a wookiee.  Around the time that he turned 18 years old, he heard about a pilot job posting for some colony on a backwater planet called Ylesia.  He attempts to escape by stealing the freighter's shuttle. In the process, Shrike catches him but the wookiee saves him at the cost of her own life. Han promises that if there's ever a chance for him to help out another wookiee, he'll do it.  He escapes, stows away on a ship that is headed for Ylesia, which ends up crashing on the planet. When he wakes up in medical bay, he gets the job.

The colony is run by a cult which has some weird addictive religious ceremony. In the background, all the pilgrims that live there have to work in the spice mines, which is the real purpose of the colony.  Han's job is to smuggle the illicit spice to other planets. He also meets and falls in love with one of the pilgrims, who has given up her original name, Bria.  They're from the same planet. Eventually, he decides that he's had enough of the place and convinces her to escape. Before he does, he blows up the spice factories. 

They make it to Corellia, their home planet, and they make contact with her (extremely rich) family, who didn't know what had happened to her.  Her mother and brother are extremely suspicious of Han. The father is pretty okay with him. They end up leaving for Coruscant, where Han will be trying to enter the Imperial Academy, to become a pilot with the Empire. All Han's accounts end up frozen.  Garris Shrike tracks him down on Coruscant, to try to collect on the substantial bounty that the Ylesian priests put on him.  Han kills him. Bria's father wires her some money for the Academy entrance fees. Still struggling with the addiction to the cult ceremony, Bria decides to leave and go fuck knows where. But she gives the money to Han. He enters the Academy.

There's a time jump of about five years. We understand that he completed the Academy and went into the Navy. Chewie was on a slave detail that Han had to supervise when one of the higher-up officers tried to beat and/or kill Chewie. Han protected him and got court martialed.  Chewie swore a life debt to him, which Han is initially totally against. He becomes his sidekick and copilot.

They end up in the employ of Jabba and Jabba's cousin (?). Bounty hunters harass him from time to time. When Boba Fett has him dead to rights one time, Lando is the one who helps him out of the situation, which is how they all first meet. Around this time, the Empire decides that they are going to start cracking down on smugglers, which they say are helping out the Rebellion.  The Hutts bribe the man in charge of the fleet that is planning to attack the smuggler stronghold, just to get the battle plans. The smuggler fleet beats the Imperials. Han is the messenger between Jabba and the officer when he delivers the second half of the bribe payment. While he's there, Darth Vader shows up to confront the officer. He kills him while Han is hiding in the closet.  Han has to escape from the ship, and his ship gets attacked and destroyed by the imperials. 

Han goes to the World Series of Poker on Bespin. In the last hand, which Lando is also a part of, Lando includes the Millennium Falcon in the pot.  Han ends up winning. Imperials are being a bunch of dicks around this time, massacring people all over the galaxy, wherever there is unrest. Bria makes contact with Han, and asks for his help, along with the help of the smugglers, in order to attack and destroy the Ylesian colony. Did I mention she was part of the rebellion? Yeah. Han convinces a bunch of smugglers that they're going to get the spice from the factories as payment for their help in destroying Ylesia.  So a bunch of people go along with it. Bria, the bitch, betrays everybody and steals everything before they blow up the entire colony.  Han becomes an outcast because the smugglers think he was in on it the whole time. 

Han has to go to Kessel, on the instructions from Jabba, to pick up a shipment of spice from THAT place.  A Star Destroyer is harassing him the whole time. Han has to empty his cargo holds to avoid being arrested.  His plan is to go back for it later on. He ends up losing it, which means that he owes Jabba for the price of the shipment. Because of his problems with the Ylesia operation, he has nobody to help him out with the debt. He ends up on Tattooine, where he finds out that Bria was killed in the operation where the Death Star plans were stolen (imagine that).  Immediately afterwards, Chewie tells him that somebody wants to talk to him about a charter flight to Alderaan.  

And those are the basics of three books' worth of Han Solo backstory. Not like it matters. It's not canon anymore.

post,5fwttw,What documentary has affected you the most?,"Lately I have been watching a lot of documentaries, the 2 that have really stuck with me were The Act Of Killing and Grizzly Man. I found the act of killing to be a constantly shocking and horrifying look and some of the main perpetrators of the genocide that took place in the 1960's in Indonesia. It's so horrifying how these men are delighted to talk about their horrific past and show almost no remorse. Grizzly Man, another fantastic documentary by Werner Herzog which is about Timothy treadwell a man who spent 13 summers in the forest with bears and foxes. Well one day his dangerous practices caught up with him, he and his partner amie were mauled by bears. This film delves into Timothy's life and his battle with his inner demons. It's both extremely uplifting along with tragic.

comment,danoeya,,"The one that forever remains with me, despite having watched so many, will be Talhotblonde. It's on Netflix,

Without giving it away, it's the story of two different men who work together, who both fall in love with a gorgeous blonde in her early twenties over the Internet. Things go dark quick. 

The movie takes a twist so fast towards the end that the Usual Suspects goes ""Oh fuck you"". 

The worst part of all, is that my friend actually encountered one of the two men in public. He blurted out his internet handle and the guy ran away. 

What forever gets me about this movie is that it's my golden goose: the one that got away. I've looked all over for fucked up documentaries since then, with crazy plots and utterly bizarre stories but none have hit the high of this.

comment,danpeh8,,"So I'm not sure how many people have seen it, but I own the PBS documentary called [""A Lion in the House.""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492472/?ref_=nv_sr_1) It is about childhood cancer and how it affects the children and families. It is about 6-7 hours long, but it is one of those that doesn't feel long.

It is, by **far**, the saddest thing I have ever watched in my life. I'd say a majority of the kids that are in the documentary don't make it, and I think this doc would make even the most macho man cry for hours. 

It isn't just a ""make yourself as sad as possible"" documentary though, it really shows how unbelievably hard it is to be a childhood oncologist. My respect for them is absolutely through the roof after watching that documentary. It might be the hardest job on the planet.

comment,danz14q,,"Dear Zachary and Capturing The Friedmans will probably come up here a lot.

I love Touching The Void. It's about an incident where a mountain climber slipped down a crevasse and his climbing partner had to make the difficult decision to cut the rope (as it was impossible for him to pull the other guy back up/the other guy was very likely killed in the fall). He wasn't. Once the rope is cut, the guy is stuck in the crevasse with a broken leg and basically has to climb back down the mountain by himself. It's intense and emotional. Also they use the music 'Speigel Im Speigel' by Arvo Part which always destroys me emotionally.

Lastly... 6 ago, when I was around 16 there was a 1hr long TV documentary on Channel 4 that sticks to me this day. Lost Abroad: The Parents' Story. It was about students that had studied abroad and gone missing/been killed from the pov of the parents. One of the threads is about the family of the British student, Lindsay Hawker, in Japan(?) who was murdered and put in a bath of sand. The family has to repeatedly make trips to Japan to try to drum up awareness/get the Japanese authorities to put some effort into finding her killer. It's awkward and  heartbreaking because the family have to toe the line between showing their desperation and anger and respecting cultural differences.

The second thread is the one that properly burned its way inside of me and upsets me to this day. A mother tells the story of her son Jeremiah Duggan who studied abroad in France. He makes some friends and they go on a road trip to Germany. The guy is Jewish and the 'friends' turn out to be going to a (Neo-Nazish?) convention for a guy called LaRouche. The mum describes the moment her son rang her frightened out of his mind asking for help. He turns up dead in the middle of a road, having been knocked over. The German authorities refuse to classify it as murder/manslaughter and say the guy walked into traffic on purpose. Honestly can't explain how much this affected me. I feel so fucking awful for the mother. 

This was a one off tv documentary like you'll see any day of the week on TV but it stays with me which is a testament to its content, I think.",Blacknarcissa,movies,2,,2016-12-01 19:04:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5fwttw/what_documentary_has_affected_you_the_most/danz14q/,False

post,52rene,The Act of Killing,"I consider myself a decent student of history but was completely unaware of the genocide that this film examines. Whats compelling about this doc is that instead of giving us an academic account of what happened in Indonesia in the 60's it tells the story by having some of the actual murderers recount their actions by having them take part in the making of the film. These people who killed hundreds of their fellow citizens seem to take joy while re-enacting and reminiscing about killing other human beings. It was extremely unsettling to watch these people laugh and joke about how they killed an raped while having the tacit approval of the Indonesian government to target ""communists"" when it's quite clear that they simply chose their victims without much thought about wether they were communists or not. I won't say more except to provide a link to the movie's Wikipedia page and say that it's currently playing on Netflix.

post,4jgumx,Worldly Cinema: Palestine (Redux),"There's a couple countries we're going to go over with a redux post as they didn't receive the attention those countries deserved. Our Niger, Nigeria and Palestine posts for example got downvoted out of vision so we just deleted them and soon we'll do redux posts for them. If you believe that a certain country also hasn't had the recognition it deserved with these threads please send me a message and if I agree I'll do a redux for those too.

After that we'll be doing final ""Regional Posts"" hence those highlighting certain parts of the world (Europe, Middle East, East Asia, etc.) in which we can discuss our favourite films from the highlighted posts and have a spat for sweet karma. Then I'll get to spend hours of my time crafting a wonderful IMGUR album complete with months of research in order to highlight to you what films around the world /r/movies thinks showcase that country best.

We have a subreddit over at /r/WorldlyCinema which I am continuously updating with these. I don't want to spam the sub completely so these come in Alphabetic instalments. 

Today we'll be doing Palestine.

Instructions:

Post your favourite movie of the country of current thread.

If your favourite movie has already been posted give it an upvote and post another movie that you really like from that country that hasn't been already posted.

Upvote all the movies that have already been posted that you like and think deserve top honours for that country.

Please only post ONE movie per person to let others have a chance to post.

For consistency, please post only post movies whose first country on IMDB is the country we are currently on. 

DO NOT post repeats of a movie that has already been posted.",ZamrosX,movies,1,1.0,2016-05-15 16:40:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4jgumx/worldly_cinema_palestine_redux/,True

post,4jbw5x,Worldly Cinema: Nigeria (Redux),"There's a couple countries we're going to go over with a redux post as they didn't receive the attention those countries deserved. Our Niger, Nigeria and Palestine posts for example got downvoted out of vision so we just deleted them and soon we'll do redux posts for them. If you believe that a certain country also hasn't had the recognition it deserved with these threads please send me a message and if I agree I'll do a redux for those too.

After that we'll be doing final ""Regional Posts"" hence those highlighting certain parts of the world (Europe, Middle East, East Asia, etc.) in which we can discuss our favourite films from the highlighted posts and have a spat for sweet karma. Then I'll get to spend hours of my time crafting a wonderful IMGUR album complete with months of research in order to highlight to you what films around the world /r/movies thinks showcase that country best.

We have a subreddit over at /r/WorldlyCinema which I am continuously updating with these. I don't want to spam the sub completely so these come in Alphabetic instalments. 

Today we'll be doing Niger.

comment,d37b71x,,"I'm surprised there's been no uptake on this one. Nigeria's the most populous country in Africa and Nollywood is huge, at least in terms of output it's second only to Bollywood and is watched more widely across Africa and amongst the Nigerian diaspora worldwide.

Just the combination of low budgets and sheer output creating a lot of bad films? Not enough Africans on reddit?",Bobbobthebob,movies,2,,2016-05-16 09:50:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4jbw5x/worldly_cinema_nigeria_redux/d37b71x/,False
post,4j766f,Worldly Cinema: Niger (Redux),"There's a couple countries we're going to go over with a redux post as they didn't receive the attention those countries deserved. Our Niger, Nigeria and Palestine posts for example got downvoted out of vision so we just deleted them and soon we'll do redux posts for them. If you believe that a certain country also hasn't had the recognition it deserved with these threads please send me a message and if I agree I'll do a redux for those too.

After that we'll be doing final ""Regional Posts"" hence those highlighting certain parts of the world (Europe, Middle East, East Asia, etc.) in which we can discuss our favourite films from the highlighted posts and have a spat for sweet karma. Then I'll get to spend hours of my time crafting a wonderful IMGUR album complete with months of research in order to highlight to you what films around the world /r/movies thinks showcase that country best.

We have a subreddit over at /r/WorldlyCinema which I am continuously updating with these. I don't want to spam the sub completely so these come in Alphabetic instalments. 

Today we'll be doing Niger.

post,4ivi8n,Worldly Cinema: Zimbabwe,"Welp. We've done it. We've finally done it. We've made it to the end. We've gone through every country in the world (Missing out a couple because of volume issues. The Vatican City, unsurprisingly, doesn't have a large filmmaking scene.) So what comes next? 

Well. There's a couple countries we're going to go over with a redux post as they didn't receive the attention those countries deserved. Our Niger, Nigeria and Palestine posts for example got downvoted out of vision so we just deleted them and soon we'll do redux posts for them. If you believe that a certain country also hasn't had the recognition it deserved with these threads please send me a message and if I agree I'll do a redux for those too.

After that we'll be doing final ""Regional Posts"" hence those highlighting certain parts of the world (Europe, Middle East, East Asia, etc.) in which we can discuss our favourite films from the highlighted posts and have a spat for sweet karma. Then I'll get to spend hours of my time crafting a wonderful IMGUR album complete with months of research in order to highlight to you what films around the world /r/movies thinks showcase that country best.

We have a subreddit over at /r/WorldlyCinema which I am continuously updating with these. I don't want to spam the sub completely so these come in Alphabetic instalments. 

Today we'll be doing Zimbabwe.

post,4ie3ht,Worldly Cinema: Yemen,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Yemen.

post,4i4htc,Worldly Cinema: Vietnam,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Vietnam.

comment,d2vsu25,,"A beautiful film that captures life inside a 1950s home in Saigon. The cinemotography is splendid in capturing a Vietnam that doesn't exist in the modern era. The staging and architecture of a colorful home, integrated with the city and outdoors with its open build, is stunning. Although the dialogue is minimal, there is much to take in through your senses. The cooking scenes invite your eyes to taste and smell the aromas while the grasshoppers build up the background noise.

Not for everyone as its pace may be too slow for some viewers but I'd recommend it if you are searching for a natural aesthetic and artistic film. The continous shots from a voyeuristic POV makes it as if you are living through the main character inside the home.",SuperLobster,movies,2,,2016-05-06 23:46:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4i4htc/worldly_cinema_vietnam/d2vsu25/,False

post,4hmmhb,Worldly Cinema: Venezuela,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Venezuela.

post,4h92di,Worldly Cinema: Uzbekistan,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Uzbekistan.

comment,d2poc81,,"[Uzbekfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekfilm) has produced over 400 feature films and 100 animated films since its creation 90 years ago. It was taken over by the Uzbek government in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell, and now produces a limited number of films every year. None of which have gained as much international recognition as the Soviet Era films. 

To this day, Uzbekistan hasn't submitted a single film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. And was drowned out in the Soviet Era by primarily Russian films.

post,4h1sdv,Worldly Cinema: Uruguay,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Sorry about my 20+ day long quasi-leave of absence. Personal things have to take priority over reddit I'm afraid. Anyways.

Today we'll be doing Uruguay.

comment,d2o4qda,,"Manuel Facal's ""Relocos y Repasados"", known abroad as ""High Five"", is my favorite as it represents much of nowadays Uruguayan youth culture and its relation with drugs (could easily be most anywhere youth culture) . What I really liked about this movie is how it uses as a core the lowest of cinema storytelling (American comedies... even has an American Pie's Stifler clone!), but gradually adds several layers ranging from B movies quirkiness, psychedelic images, some manga-inspired histrionics and shots, social commentary, and a well-thought variety of story devices that never feel forced, but add to making an extremely fun, fast-paced movie.

I happened to find an Uruguayan film-maker in a bar when Relocos hit the screens, and I asked him what he thought about it. He said: ""Relocos has more shots and color than all Uruguayan movies TOGETHER"", which in my opinion summarizes in a sentence how ""Relocos"" threwed all this Uruguayan tradition of non-pop cinema away.

Extras for movie buffs:
""25 Watts"": the ode to the high ninties local youth culture.
""Whisky"": seemingly best Uruguayan film, pleases mainstream and indie critics.
""La Espera"": the Uruguayan movie that local film-makers love.

post,4dnd16,Worldly Cinema: United States,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing the United States.

comment,d1sno48,,"Isn't this kinda pointless? 

The reason why you do things to highlight ""world"" cinema is because the US dominates the global film industry. If you're going to do this for the US at least make it more mind-opening by setting up some guidelines:

* **No films produced by a major studio**
* **No films that made over $20M**
* **No films that were nominated for Best Picture**

Make it interesting, not just the usual litany of films everyone will inevitably chime in with (only an hour old and it's already the usual suspects).",Cinemaphreak,movies,-3,,2016-04-06 21:01:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4dnd16/worldly_cinema_united_states/d1sno48/,False

post,4dcupu,Worldly Cinema: United Kingdom,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe.

post,4d7l7x,Worldly Cinema: United Arab Emirates,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing United Arab Emirates.

post,4d2tx0,Worldly Cinema: Ukraine,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Ukraine.

post,4cma2u,Worldly Cinema: Uganda,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Uganda.

It's a Ugandan action movie made on a ridiculously shoe string budget ($200?) and it's just crazy and fun. It's available for free on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEoGrbKAyKE

post,4cb85c,Worldly Cinema: Turkmenistan,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Turkmenistan.

post,4bdak0,Worldly Cinema: Tunisia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Tunisia.

post,4b7l7g,Worldly Cinema: Trinidad and Tobago,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Trinidad and Tobago.

post,49vf3a,Worldly Cinema: Thailand,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Thailand.

post,49pfqi,Worldly Cinema: Taiwan,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Taiwan.

I watched this in the second run theaters. I had a lot of trouble understanding the conversation because they often swapped between Taiwanese and Mandarin, but after a few more watches it grew on me.

Kind of similar to the Japanese anime where they have ""cook-off"" competitions, but with a Taiwanese twist.

comment,d0ukgfn,,"My *favorite* Taiwanese movie is [Seven Days In Heaven / 父後七日](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk4riHqzJ48).

[Here's a review](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/seven-days-heaven-film-review-29438) and [here is the IMDb page](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1745704/).

Basically, it's a dark comedy about a woman who loses her father. She must return home and undergo the somewhat intense process of a traditional Taiwanese funeral. She is returning from Taipei to the countryside, so she is reminded of her old life and starts to reflect on life as she undergoes the rituals of the funeral.

If you want to understand some of the *local* aspects of Taiwanese life, I feel this is an *excellent* film to watch. Whenever I have the opportunity, I share it with friends, and I encourage everyone here to seek it out and view.

As an aside, my first time to see it was in a theater, which just so happened to be hosting the director and screenwriter. It was fascinating to listen to their filming process.",None,movies,3,,2016-03-10 10:49:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/49pfqi/worldly_cinema_taiwan/d0ukgfn/,False

post,49ju9d,Worldly Cinema: Tanzania,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Tanzania.

 - The subject is a bit dark but I liked the movie for its honest/accurate depiction of Tanzania and Tanzanians. (Not that Tanzania or Tanzanians can be generalized by this movie but as a Tanzanian, I didn't have to suspend belief even for a minute!)

post,49dvdw,Worldly Cinema: Tajikistan,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Tajikistan.

comment,d0r0xok,,"I live in Tajikistan and there are really no films made here, although a lot of production effort goes into creating music videos, so that seems to be the hot-spot for the nascent cinema industry here.

Here is one recent example: http://youtu.be/UithzBan-lA

I have only ever heard of two or three feature-length films from Tajikistan, which aren't even that well known inside the country. One that gained popularity recently is called ""Arusi Zamonavi"", meaning ""Modern Bride"". It's about a guy who marries a girl who is all Russianized and goes to live with her in-laws, where she struggles to adapt to village life.

Found its trailer here: http://youtu.be/tpSzvxpQQ8w

It's noteworthy because it's filmed in Dushanbe and shows actual locations that that locals are familiar with.",marmulak,movies,2,,2016-03-07 18:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/49dvdw/worldly_cinema_tajikistan/d0r0xok/,False

comment,d1c1gmt,,"Without a doubt, the first movie that comes to my mind is [The Syrian Bride](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0423310/).

 It's a cultural crossover between the Israeli-Jew culture and the Syrian-Druze culture, and what life is like in Majdal Shames, The Golan Heights for the residents and those who are in between borders. It was released in 2004 and the story is set in the year 2000 near the death of former president Hafez Al-Assad. One of my favorite taglines that accurately describes the premise of the film and, well, a big portion of weddings in the culture is: 

> A wedding in the family, usually a happy event for everyone involved, turns out to be a sad affair.

The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a long time! And the acting and accents are better done than today's big budget films and TV shows! It's very impressive and emotional to those who are familiar with the cultures or those who are really willing to know more about it.",RobotReMade8899604,movies,1,,2016-03-24 17:58:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4943bd/worldly_cinema_syria/d1c1gmt/,False
comment,d1c321j,,"Another one I'd suggest is the TV show [Qalam Homra](https://m.youtube.com/#/playlist?list=PLLcpeauQVc1u2W4PiNRB9oif2t9iFYwVE) (means ""A Rouge Lipstick"").

Although this one's an underground show, it's one of the most accurate portrayals of Syrians lives in almost all ages, life stages, ambitions, and circumstances in modern television. The dialogue comes shocking at times, and mundane and true at other times, making it difficult not to relate to.

Set in the year 2010 in Damascus, one year before the war, and slowly progressing to the year 2014, the year it was released in, Qalam Homra touches on the lives of numerous characters and their survival against all of their issues (Religion, Creative Suppression, Politics and Economics, Depression, Homosexuality, Women's rights, Teenagers, Family... etc). As a Syrian, I can't help but relate to each character and be reminded of the best and of the worst of life in Damascus before the war, I've found myself crying in multiple parts of it. Despite the fact that it was shot in Lebanon, I rarely felt that it isn't actually Bab Toma, Bab Sharqi, and all the other places the scenes accurately rebuilt from Damascus. As well as the eargasmic, ""La Fabeluex Destin D'Amélie Poulain"" based soundtrack.

Despite being 30 episodes long (which is the Syrian TV cliché), the show is quite short and, in my opinion, needed more episodes to be able to convey a better message.

One thing unfortunate about the show is that it's completely in Syrian Arabic, and it is not translated or subtitled in English for the international audience. Translating the episodes though is one item on my ""things to do before I die"" list.",RobotReMade8899604,movies,1,,2016-03-24 18:33:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4943bd/worldly_cinema_syria/d1c321j/,False

> The old farm worker Pipe is old enough to retire. Even so he cannot imagine a life without work. So he keeps on doing his job and wonders what to do with his additional financial means. Soon a small moped comes to mind. Thus motorised he starts to explore the world around his village. One day he gets overly confident and drives under the influence of alcohol. This costs him his driver's license. But before this incident he has become the owner of a camera. Now he turns into a diligent photographer. Craving for new picture angles he even books a helicopter flight. With each little adventure he cares less for his old job until he embraces his retirement.

post,48gsxr,Worldly Cinema: Sweden,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Sweden.

post,47csxy,Worldly Cinema: Suriname,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Suriname.

Instructions:

Post your favourite movie of the country of current thread.

If your favourite movie has already been posted give it an upvote and post another movie that you really like from that country that hasn't been already posted.

Upvote all the movies that have already been posted that you like and think deserve top honours for that country.

Please only post ONE movie per person to let others have a chance to post.

For consistency, please post only post movies whose first country on IMDB is the country we are currently on. 

DO NOT post repeats of a movie that has already been posted.",ZamrosX,movies,6,1.0,2016-02-24 14:21:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/47csxy/worldly_cinema_suriname/,True

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413358/

The film was banned in Sri Lanka if I remember correctly because of its drug use, sex (both of which offended traditional sensibilities), and its critical attitudes about the civil war. I think the director was essentially black listed from the country.

It's great because it is very non-standard in terms of Sri Lankan cinema. It's a rare example of Sri Lankan cinema being used to up turn conventional social norms. ",troymcclurehere,movies,4,,2016-02-24 02:44:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/476lqz/worldly_cinema_sri_lanka/d0bgz2g/,False

post,46vraz,Worldly Cinema: Spain,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Spain.

comment,d089gtd,,"Aside from the already mentioned and fantastic [*Amanece que no Es Poco*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094641/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3), the genre of post-civil war comedy was a source of much awesomeness, although a lot of jokes can fall flat when you are not familiar with the culture and common idiosyncrasies of that time period.

* [*El Milagro de P. Tinto*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151572/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) (The Miracle of P. Tinto) is for me in the same tier as *Amenece que no Es Poco*, and one of the most amazing comedies of all time.

* [*Bienvenido Mr. Marshall*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045554/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) (Welcome Mr. Marshall), although significantly older, it hasn't in my opinion lost any comedic value over the years. It focuses on the townsfolk of one of the impoverished villages through where the aid trucks from the American Marshall Plan were projected to pass.

From other genres:

* [The Others](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/): yes, you probably already know about this one, but given that the director is Spanish and it was filmed in Spain I thought I would mention it (even though the cast are all foreign, and it's originally in English). A very good horror film in my opinion; while it has a few jump scares, it has a core of psychological horror which is very well done.

post,46q994,Worldly Cinema: South Africa,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing South Africa.

comment,d07k9zf,,"**Faan se Trein**. It is an Afrikaans movie (don't worry it has English subtitles) about a mentally challenged man, Faan, in a Karoo town in the 40s. The town has accepted him even if he causes trouble but the sneaky wife of the new town doctor wants to see to his downfall. Faan is at a nexus in his life because his elderly father is not long for the world. Beautifully shot period film with excellent costumes and sets. 

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ps-q3Nk1hA)

Kind of mind-blowing if you know that the actor playing Faan is Willie Esterhuizen who is more known for his low brow comedies (not an insult, they are generally much fun)

..


**Stuur Groete aan Mannetjies Roux**. Another Afrikaans movie (also subtitled) about a family on a Karoo farm (I have a soft spot for the Karoo) with secrets that is slowly leaking. A stern but loving wife who loves her endearing husband of many years dearly despite his faults, a daughter losing her innocence, an old family acquaintance arrives to scratch open old wounds and an earthly wise wanderer working on the farm with insightful observations.

comment,d07fiug,,"Tsotsi because it has an interestering story and gives a unique look at South African culture. Why is is so much worse ?
1.The cinematography is worse.
2.The acting is worse.
3.The overall editing is worse.
4.It simply isn't as enjoyable nor memorable (you can say this is personal opinion however both sales figures and overall rating will prove otherwise.) 

The South African film industry isn't that strong,we have extremely few A list releases.The biggest sector of our film industry is comedy which while some are decently funny they generally lack any substance and are mostly just random pranks strung together.The Afrikaans sector mainly just produces straight up rip offs of English versions of the film or they follow extremely generic plots so that you know exactly how it will end by only watching the first five minutes of the film.District 9 was something completely new and unique,it was done with high quality acting,editing and equipment,the plot was something completely original and the finished product is still unlike anything produced in South Africa before and since it released.

However if you can point out an movie that was in your opinion better I'll be happy to reconsider. ",justanotherepic,movies,1,,2016-02-20 21:48:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/46q994/worldly_cinema_south_africa/d07fiug/,False

post,46ktiv,Worldly Cinema: Somalia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Somalia.

post,46asar,Worldly Cinema: Slovenia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Slovenia.

comment,d04il6p,,"Maja and the Starboy(1988)

Incidentially, the IMDB storyline for this movie is a naked lie. The film is basically redoing E.T., what with an interstellar spaceship and then having to run from people (although in this case, it is the aliens who are chasing them, not the FBI).

But the ending is not, in fact, happy. What basically happens is that Maya and her Starboy are torn apart and can never see each other again and Maya cries and screams and then the movie ends. I mean, nobody DIES, but it's still a fuck-you ending for a children's movie.",DowagerInUnrentVeils,movies,1,,2016-02-18 14:46:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/46asar/worldly_cinema_slovenia/d04il6p/,False

comment,d04s0jj,,"Slovenian cenima is percieved to be mostly depressing dramas and as trying too hard to be 'relevant' and 'artistic' among Slovenians, but the new generation of directors (Nejc Gazvoda, Matevž Luzar) are coming out with fresh ideas and changing that perception with simple, likeable and 'light' films, if I dare to say so.

Examples:

[Izlet - a trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7lbusiWr-o)  

[Full movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyRGzQpos_8)
A simple, nice film anybody can relate to about three friends from high school going on holiday to the seaside. Of course, time has passed and they changed. 
I know somebody already said it, but here's the movie, with english subtitles.

[Dvojina - dual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6cV-YeMds)

[Full movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj-0QXrbnmk)
Once acagain, a nice, really well-made movie, that's not too difficult. I didn't find a subtitled version, but most of the film is in english, as our two protagonists can only undertand eachother through english.

[Srečen za umret - good to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv88wGbd2zk) A bit of a slow movie (true to it's storyline), but it picks up, a nice bittersweet comedy about old age.

If interested in downloading movies, Partis.si is the site to go, as it is a slovenian torrent site. Warning - Ratio based

post,45xymk,Worldly Cinema: Slovakia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Slovakia. Films from Czechoslovakia are fine, but to count them their primary language must be Slovak. Any Czech language films will be considered Czech.

comment,d00yfnw,,"In the United States, the only ""Slovak"" movie that you could probably get your hands on is ""Shop on Main Street"" (Obchod na korze) which won an academy award for best foreign language film in the 60's and has a Criterion Collection release. I put ""Slovak"" in quotes because all of the movies back then in the former Czechoslovakia were typically in Czech language, although cast and crew were typically from both. ""Shop on Main Street"" was set and filmed in Slovakia and in Slovak language.
What is generally considered the greatest Czech/Czechoslovakian movie though was ""Marketa Lazarova"", which while being in Czech language, set in medieval Bohemia, featured Slovak actors (including the title character Marketa).
So, depending on your criteria, either Shop on Main Street or Marketa Lazarova, which are both now available worldwide by Criterion and are two of the greatest movies ever made, anywhere.

post,45roha,Worldly Cinema: Singapore,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Singapore.

post,45latj,Worldly Cinema: Serbia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Serbia.

post,45akmh,Worldly Cinema: Senegal,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Senegal.

post,454lf3,Worldly Cinema: Saudi Arabia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Saudi Arabia.

comment,czwtqrj,,"Movie theaters are banned in Saudi. As a result, there are no film production studios. Filmmakers have to finance their own films since there are no sources of funding for them. The most they can do is make short-films and hope to screen them at film-festivals. Moreover, there is also no real theater industry (just all-male comedy stage productions), and as a result finding actors is very  difficult. There is no market for actors here. The art scene here in the country is very tragic. Much of it is either obscure or underground. 

The clerics have made sure that no vibrant art scene ever emerges. Almost all art forms are forbidden. Portraits and sculptures are forbidden because they depict human beings, which Islam forbids. Movies and plays are forbidden because they often involve the interaction of the sexes, and unveiled women, both of which Islam forbids. They couldn't prevent literature, music, and photography. Since many works of literature challenge their ideas, they have condemned many of them. They can't take a stand against literature because Muslims have always had literature. Plus, literature is more ancient than Islam, and is as an entrenched in human societies human societies as is religion, but of course literature is much more beautiful than religion. Also, musicians release their albums through productions studios that are based outside of the country. Ironically, two of the largest Arab music production studios are owned by Saudis, but they cannot operate in Saudi because of the clerics. Also, for a very long time, musicians weren't allowed to play in the country, and today they can play in only one city (Jeddah). But live music shows are very very rare. There is a rising underground music scene, but that just highlights the sad reality that they can't play publicly.

The comedic skits that we call ""plays"" are not actual theater. Theater involves serious playwriting and dramatism. Commercial laughter shows on a stage don't count.

You're wrong on this point, and it's funny you should be so wrong on this week of all weeks of the year. This week is the annual [21, 39 art week](http://21-39.com/21-39/program.html) in which all the galleries of Jeddah open their new exhibits. The events are all mixed-gender and the art includes both portraits and sculptures. Though you're right that there are no sculptures of the human form. Posters for the event cover half the billboards of the city, and the event is done in coordination with the local government. 95% of the events are not underground at all.

comment,czx1z64,,"The only other feature is actually premiering tonight at Berlinale, a RomCom by Mahmoud Sabbagh called [""Barakah Yoqabil Barakah""](https://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.php?film_id=201614526#tab=filmStills) or ""Barakah Meets Barakah.""

The industry here is still in its infancy. Most local film-makers are self-taught beginners or fresh graduates from NYFA. There are a few more shorts coming out, but still, everyone's trying to find their legs, and few people are truly prepared to delve into a feature.

The other problem as /u/makaruna mentioned is the lack of funding for films. So instead, the most financially successful in the industry are those who do television, in which case the Saudi industry is much stronger.

comment,czx2nbe,,"Art exhibitions in the one city in the country where many strict laws are relaxed hardly constitutes a ""vibrant"" art scene. I know Riyadh has some art galleries too, but that doesn't mean it's a vibrant art scene. Plus, by ""art"" here I was talking about all arts, which includes cinema, theater, music, literature, and all of that. Artists fall under all of these categories. If we're going to talk one type of art, then in Riyadh there is a vibrant photography community that participates in regional and international competition. That alone doesn't make it a vibrant art scene, though. 

A vibrant art scene would be one that inspires participation, excitement, and self-expression. You'd see more artists being enthusiastic about participation than dreading the fact that an art-scene hardly exists in the country. 

Also, just a curious question, what kind of paintings are exhibited? Do they allow portraits of human beings? (This is an honest question, not a rhetorical question)",None,movies,2,,2016-02-12 07:06:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/454lf3/worldly_cinema_saudi_arabia/czx2nbe/,False
comment,czx340d,,"I honestly can't speak for other cities. I tend to avoid them. In Jeddah the art scene really does inspire participation. Lots of artists from other parts of the country come to Jeddah for the events. There's always work by new up and comers. I honestly don't see many people complaining that ""an art scene doesn't exist."" More of wishing there was less pressure on them to censor themselves, or for it to be a better art scene (better in the sense of the quality of the art). Portraits are allowed, but you don't see many of them, probably since they're not in fashion. You barely see any paintings at all. Most of the artists go for installations. I only went to 2 of the 4 openings so far, and have only seen maybe 2 or 3 portraits.

Film is growing as I mentioned in my other comment, but still has a ways to go. Don't know anything about arabic literature, so can't comment on that. But yeah, theater and live music are way behind.",None,movies,1,,2016-02-12 07:30:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/454lf3/worldly_cinema_saudi_arabia/czx340d/,False
comment,czx3m59,,"Yup, don't go to other cities. Whenever I visit Jeddah (or the Damma-Khobar-Dahran tricity for that matter), I feel like I'm in a different country. Jeddah is as open as the country gets. Plus, the religious police is practically nonexistent there. If they were, forget about gender mixing ever happening. 

Also, I'm interested to see how portraits would be welcomed in other cities. I remember they used to reprimand us at school for drawing human figures. 

I know about literature, and I can say that the state of literature from Saudi today is...hard to describe. Some years are better than others. In the past, Saudis have made important contributions to modern Arabic literature, but are far from being top-tier producers. The market for Arabic novels in general has also been flooded with commercial novels, rather than novels with some degree of literary quality.  

But in the end, I don't seen an environment for artists in this country. The potential, the passion, the talent, the imagination, the skills, and all of that is definitely there. It's just that the space that allows them to release their energy is not present.

post,44w8mo,Worldly Cinema: Samoa,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

post,43pk7d,Worldly Cinema: Russia,"Hi all. So I really enjoyed the series of Yearly Cinema threads, and thought I would do one for films from countries across the globe. The World is full of fantastic cinema, from the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of South America. I thought I'd get this started in order for redditors to introduce other redditors to films that aren't just limited to the US or other English speaking countries (Although we will get round to those eventually).
I'll try to do this daily, starting with the A-countries and working down to the Z-countries.
Hopefully at the end we can have a comprehensive, reddit-inspired list of the cinema of the World.

We also have a subreddit now over at /r/WorldlyCinema

Today we'll be doing Russia.

My time to shine!  I love Russian film!

Сибириада (Siberiade) is an epic that follows the fate of two families and the village they come from in Siberia over the course of the 20th Century.  It is a fantastically beautiful film with an incredible story.  It's nearly 4 hours long, but it's worth every second.  

When I watched it, I fell in love with Russia all over again.  

It'll take some hunting to find subtitles, but I've found them before.  

If you liked Brother (Брат), you'll also probably enjoy Bodrov, Jr. (the starring actor) in his main film debut, Prisoner of the Mountains (Кавказкий Пленник).  Featuring a fantastic supporting performance by my favorite Russian actor, Oleg Menshikov, Prisoner of the Mountains is about a grizzled veteran sergeant (Menshikov) and a green, young recruit (Bodrov, Jr.) who are captured by insurgents in the Caucasus (in what is presumably the First Chechen War).  It's really humane, thoughtful, and even delightful (although, as with most Russian stories, it ends sadly).

Also worth watching is Burnt by the Sun (also starring Menshikov), Bumer, and Bumer: Film Vtoroj.  Bumer is a really good gangster road trip movie, and its sequel is a sort of melancholy crime drama that's really full of heart and thought.

If you're up for a movie that will haunt you, Come and See is a movie about occupied Belarus and the Nazi atrocities which took place there.",JCAPS766,movies,7,,2016-02-02 00:16:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/43pk7d/worldly_cinema_russia/czkd0g6/,False

Three young Russians from very different walks of life involutarily enter the military to escape their past. Demobbed (Russian: ДМБ) is a cult Russian comedy film by Roman Kachanov, offering an absurdistic view on the Russian army by the eyes of a conscript. Brutal Dedovshchina, the major problem of the Russian society, is shown not as a tragedy, but as an idylically insane process of resocialization. (wikipedia)

There are sequels to that film and they are terrible. The original movie is a masterpiece.


**Down House (2001)**

Down House (Russian: Даун Хаус) is a 2001 Russian comedy-gross-out film by Roman Kachanov, a spoof parody on The Idiot novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

The plot is set in modern Moscow, probably in the second half of the 1990s, with New Russians, Hummer H1 jeeps, bribery, violence, truckfuls of tinned stew as a dowry, and so on. The film is quite far from the novel's subject, but still keeps to the main storyline. (wikipedia)

Here are two more by him:

[War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309047/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_7)

A really great film about the Chechen War. It is an action flick at first glance, but it really does explore some serious themes. Stars Sergei Bodrov Jr in a supporting role.

[Morfiy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186366/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_3)

Historical film based on Bulgakov's (author of A Dog's Heart and Master and Margarita) semi biographical short stories. The screenplay was written by Sergei Bodrov Jr (the lead actor in Brat, Brat 2) who was supposed to star in the film, but after his untimely death the role was played by another young talented actor.

Here is a great film by a young Russian director, Roman Karimov:

[Inadequate People](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1722450/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

It's completely dialogue based, so may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's brilliant.

[Durak (Fool)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3560686/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

The main character is found near death in a shelled out tank, makes a miraculous full recovery and appears to have a supernatural understanding of tanks saying he can hear them speak to him as well as praying to some sort of tank/war god.

post,qxdie9,I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THIS ANIMATION,"This is my first post on Reddit, so apologies if I've messed up. I'm not sure if I did the flair correctly. 

So when I was growing up, my parents had several old Chinese films and animations on a set of CDs. Since I've grown up, we've lost pretty much all of them, or at the very least I don't know which CD has this specific film. There was one film that I remember quite fondly and I no longer remember all the details, but it was about a crane that drew itself with a calligraphy brush. My description is going to be a bunch of mumbo jumbo because I'm trying to remember details about a film that I haven't really thought about in over a decade, but here goes nothing. 

What I remember is that it started with a calligraphy brush that was used to draw a crane on a piece of paper. The crane came to life and started doing its thing, I don't remember what the thing was. However, for some reason or another, the crane slowly started falling apart, and it was racing to get back to the place it first started. Parts of the crane would fall apart as it moved. By the time it returned to the painting, it was only a single stroke of a line. The film was drawn in very muted tones and the design was entirely done in a very Chinese calligraphic art style. 

Does anyone know what I am talking about? Better yet, do you have a copy of the film? I suddenly felt a wave of nostalgia for the film and I couldn't find it anywhere online. Even if the film that you have doesn't perfectly match, that's okay. Chances are, I've made some errors in recalling the film.

post,gev4w7,"Animation ""shot type"" question for my final paper","Hey everyone, I'm a film student finishing up writing my final course paper, and a part of it is we have to take a scene from a movie and create a breakdown list of every shot, along with the type of shot it is.

The film I've chosen is Don Hertzfeldt's ""It's Such a Beautiful Day"", and I'm really not sure how to categorize the types of shots when almost every shot looks like [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/05/arts/05RDP_ITSSUCH_SPAN/05RDP_ITSSUCH_SPAN-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp).

post,1l6ziln,Korea and Indonesia Team Up for New Horror Film “NANCY” — A Rare Cross-National Co-Production,"https://preview.redd.it/zg0q8s8m5v5f1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72b958143524f5b78f7e1099e6f1b220b165d54

A unique Korea-Indonesia film collaboration is underway: a supernatural horror film titled ""NANCY"", based on a real urban legend from Indonesia's Bandung region, is entering production as a joint venture between Korean director Song Sang Min (GTG Pictures) and Manoj Punjabi, chairman of MD Entertainment, one of Indonesia’s largest entertainment companies.



# 🧩 Key details:

* Genre: Supernatural horror
* Setting: SMA 5 high school in Bandung, Indonesia
* Premise: A long-rumored Dutch ghost resurfaces among high school students. A Korean teacher and Indonesian student work together to uncover the mystery.
* Languages: Korean, Indonesian, and English
* Casting: Both Korean and Indonesian actors
* Goal: Simultaneous theatrical release in both countries
* Status: 80% of development and pre-production complete

This is one of the very few examples of a Korean-Indonesian co-production based on original IP, rather than remakes or imports, and features cross-casting and language fusion. It’s also being developed with the aim of reaching broader Asian and possibly international markets.

Director Song Sang Min is also known for his work in academia and was twice selected for the Korea Film Council’s scenario development program. He is currently also involved in a Vietnamese K-drama production about a Korean language school, collaborating with top Vietnamese talent including Vương Anhh and Ribi Sachi (FAPTV).

MD Entertainment, meanwhile, is behind some of Indonesia’s most successful local films and TV dramas, and this project marks their first formal venture with Korean partners.

# 🎬 Why this matters:

The project ""NANCY"" symbolizes a growing effort to create truly regional cinema in Asia — not just national productions exported abroad, but collaborative storytelling rooted in multiple cultures. Given the popularity of K-dramas and the rising prominence of Southeast Asian media industries, this could be a case study in how Asian nations co-develop genre films that appeal across borders.

Thoughts?  
Do you think more regional horror co-productions like this will catch on in the Asian film industry? Anyone familiar with the “Nancy” ghost story from Bandung?
